meanwhile of course theres the problem of actually writing the software it would seem to me that paying parking tickets over the internet would involve basic programming skills plus cosmetic packaging but no apparently its rocket science eventually govworkscom has 200 employees working on the site and still tuzman despairs that its not good enough to be released to the public how does a guy like james berardinelli open one of the best movie review sites on the web all by himself and 200 people cant figure out how to collect parking tickets berardinelli even writes his own reviews famous figures float in and out of view the partners smile from the covers of business magazines former atlanta mayor maynard jackson turns up as a consultant tuzman appears on tv sitting next to clinton who chairs a summit meeting on the internet meanwhile tuzman and herman under enormous pressure go through girlfriends and beards herman grows his beard and shaves it off so many times that the filmmakers finally photograph him in front of the mirror with a razor just to explain the continuity errors and tuzman\s girlfriends complain that he pays them no attention just a call is all i ask one says a simple call saying you\re thinking of me you\re busy but you miss me that would keep me going for two weeks she disappears from the film her replacement also finds tuzman a moving target there are setbacks the govworks office is broken into files are stolen but thats not as big a problem as the disappointing software and then comes the dotcom meltdown that dries up funds just when the site is turning the corner on the day govworks was sold to a competitor we learn it landed the big new york city contract

the title which can also be translated as at the height of summer captures a season of heat and humidity when motion is to be avoided and the most luxurious time of the day is waking while it is still cool the sisters meet to prepare meals gossip confess and speculate the men are more vaguely drawn the film finds it so unnecessary to conclude and solve the characters problems that after its over you may not be able to remember if it did it is not about incident but about nostalgia for the slowness and peace of days past here is tran again in the london interview my thoughts turned back to my childhood in danang remembering the time when id be waiting to fall asleep at night my mind racing from one thing to another nothing precise the smell of fruit coming in through the window a womans voice singing on the radio everything was so vague it was like a feeling of suspension if ive ever experienced harmony in my life it was then it was just a matter of translating that rhythm and that musicality into the new film reading those words i was reminded of a littleknown but evocative film by robert altman named  thieves like us

109 minutes in\r\nthe event of course beyond the valley of the dolls was rated x\r\nanyway there is a story about that if the movie were to be rated today it\r\nwould probably get an r rating with a few small cuts it was a very mild x\r\nthat was because meyer and the studio were aiming for the r rating when they\r\ndidn\t get it meyer believed the ratings board had felt obligated to give the\r\nking of the nudies an x rating lest it seem to endorse his movie\r\nto the majors because\r\nthe movie was stuck with the x meyer wanted to reedit certain scenes in order\r\nto include more nudity he shot many scenes in both x and r versions but the\r\nstudio still in the middle of a cashflow crisis wanted to rush the film into\r\nrelease meyer still waxes nostalgic for the real x version of bvd\r\nwhich exists only in his memory but includes many much steamier scenes starring\r\nthe movie\s many astonishingly beautiful heroines and villianesses the\r\nvisit to syracuse was a chance for me to see bvd again for the first time in a\r\nfew years the movie still seems to play for audiences it hasn\t dated apart\r\nfrom the rather oldfashioned narrative quality it had even at the time of its\r\nrelease it begins rather slowly because so many characters have to be\r\nestablished and such an ungainly plot has to be set in motion the story is\r\nsuch a labyrinthine juggling act that resolving it took a quadruple murder a\r\nnarrative summary a triple wedding and an epilogue but the last hour has a\r\nreal kinetic energy and the scenes beginning with zman\s psychedelic orgy and\r\nending with his death are i must say on meyer\s behalf as exciting\r\nterrifying and dynamic as any such sequence i can remember that stretch of\r\nbvd is pure cinema combining shameless melodrama highly charged\r\nimages of violence sledgehammer editing and musical overkill it works

there are wonderful set pieces in the film one of the best is the way ted tells bobby for story of the great chicago bears running back bronco nagurski who came out of retirement old and hurt and seemed to carry the whole chicago cardinals team on his back as he marched down the field in a last hurrah another is a visit to a pool hall in a neighboring town where ted wants to place a bet and bobby meets a woman who knew his father the movie ends as childhood ends in disillusionment at the real world that lies ahead bobbys mother is cruelly divested of her illusions and later lashes out at the innocent ted and then the low men come as they always do but bobbys summer had to end and at least he experienced the best of all possible kisses a movie like this is kind of a conjuring act like a lot of stephen kings recent work it is not a horror story so much as an everyday story with horror lurking in the margins its not a genre movie in other words but the story of characters we believe in and care about anton yelchin is not just a cute kid but a smart and wary one and mika boorem is not just the girl down the street but the kind of soul who inspires the best in others and anthony hopkins finds just the tired truthful note for ted brautiganwho knows the worst about men and fears for his future but still has enough faith to believe it will do a kid good to read the right books

based on the novel by oskar maria graf
bolweiser is not about literates it\s about a stupid provincial stationmaster and his nymphomaniac wife and about assorted other citizens in a town where everybody behaves like eighthgraders this is the first movie i\ve seen by fassbinder or anyone else except jerry lewis  in which the adult characters pout scream cry fib and clam up like kids they also spend a lot of time in passionate embraces which seem scarcely more mature this fulllength movie would be over in 15 minutes if the stationmaster were not so incredibly slow to realize that his wife is having an affair with the village butcher the stationmaster is also a chump when local gossips talk about the notorious affair he allows himself to be talked into actually suing them then he perjures himself with pathetic results i realize that the point of bolweiser is to be found in qualities apart from its plot indeed to discuss this plot seriously is probably a miscalculation the movie is all style great swooping zooms romantic dissolves selfpitying histrionics and blubbering protestations bolweiser has been described by andrew sarris as one of the most beautiful films ever made and by other new york critics as the distillation of fassbinder\s genius

100 minutes it is hard to show the coens\ distancing process at work without revealing the movie\s secrets but let me try the film is told from massey\s point of view there is something that he wants marylin he desires her so badly that in order to get her he would balance the massey prenup on his own head and crack it himself with a hammer we sympathize with this desire because we share it we want him to win her the question is does she want him of course she wants his money that goes with the territory but does she want to marry a millionaire or simply become one herself i was reminded of lubitsch\s great  trouble in paradise  which is about a con man a con woman who loves him but can\t afford him and a rich widow who thinks she can buy him but would be happy enough to rent him for the season by the end of that movie everyone knows all about each other and they accept the situation if we cannot have what we want they agree let us at least be able to admire the way we behaved miles and marylin acknowledge their mutual chicanery neither one is very nice but aw come on when she walks across the room and his heart leaps up or when she looks at him in a closeup that undresses itself what makes the coens pull back from this emotion why won\t they give us the payoff their setup demands we enjoy many turns of the screw in this movie but there comes a time when the screw is seated and they keep turning until they strip the groove we poor saps who invested our emotions in the movie are hung out to dry the materials are available in intolerable cruelty to create a movie with an irresistible comic payload so why must they skew it into a warning against itself that said the movie has many scenes of delicious comedy clooney and zetajones play their characters perfectly in an imperfect screenplay and the man with the asthma puffer gets the biggest single laugh since the hair gel in  theres something about mary

samurai films have a rich history and miike evokes it elegantly with traditional costumes idealistic dialogue sharp characterizations and a gloriously choreographed fight sequence that must extend in one form or another for 40 minutes i often find fight scenes in movies boring because they substitute movement for drama but in 13 assassins characters are involved who we know and understand and the general melee is broken down into structured vignettes hollywood action directors could study this film especially in the way it focuses on story in the midst of violence there is a subtext in the film the 13 assassins are essentially making a last stand for the traditional samurai code modern times are encroaching on japan and the shogunate is corrupt decadent and a hive of nepotism i was reminded in a lateral way of yamata\s  twilight samurai  2004 a very good film set in 1868 about a samurai who works for his clan as an accountant and is forced to recall the code of his tradition

there is also a disappointment in the general development of the plot i will not breathe a word about the specifics of the investigation that disappointment is that reginald kincaid rises to the occasion and becomes worthy of being known as sherlock holmes this autumn ive become more than ever aware of level 1 moviemaking in which the audience is given credit for almost no intelligence and the plot dares not provide more than the usual obligatory twists the standard cliches of this situation provide for the caine character to rise to greatness and become reconciled with the kingsley character so why not provide a surprise any surprise it is disheartening to sit in a movie and know at the 15minute mark what must be done and watch the filmmakers take another 90 minutes to do it exactly as it has always been done before

93 minutes  who knows a good line of dialogue when she hears one and must have suspected that she wasnt hearing many from this screenplay because she goes into her hyper mode and tries to use noise as a substitute for acting her sidekicks played by sarah jessica parker and kathy najimy  are more fortunate in that they are given less to do a story like this requires some kind of structure some sort of cleancut goals to be won and fates to be avoided watching hocus pocus i had no doubt that the filmmakers had talked their way through the plot to their own satisfaction without stopping to ask if it could be followed by an audience this is the kind of movie where the characters keep reciting the rules and reminding each other of their supernatural realities shrieking in alarm while we stare indifferently at the screen

113 minutes not everything in the book is quite as it seems recent developments in the ukraine have cast doubt on the now legendary intelligence operation which would cast the mossad in the unfortunate light of either not knowing or not admitting what really happened in 1965 that\s intriguing for us because the debt does a splendid job of showing key early sequences in detail to see is to believe but we might not be seeing everything because the film jumps the rails toward the end it might be worth mentioning the good parts rachel poses as a woman consulting the exnazi gynecologist who is now in buenos aries consider putting your feet in the stirrups for the surgeon of birkenau then theres an ingenious operation which i will not describe to spirit him out of his clinic and into captivity separately elaborate timing is used to allow a border crossing at a closed berlin transit station this stuff plays to the strength of cinema underlining the details of each strategy and the dangers it involves if you replay the actual events in your mind you realize all the suspense is created with editing camera angles and pov film considers time and space subjectively seen from a different perspective there may be no telling what was really going on the architecture of the debt has an unfortunate flaw the younger versions of the characters have scenes that are intrinsically more exciting but the actors playing the older versions are more interesting helen mirren tom wilkinson and ciaran hinds bring along the weight of their many earlier roles to be sure the older actors get some excitement of their own but by then the plot has lost its way

the movie written and directed by the married pair of stephanie argy and alec boehm doesnt fall back on stunts chases or extended gun battles its in the honorable tradition of the heist movie that involves blueprints plans and the need to be very very quiet theres a nice scene when a safe is opened just behind an open door in shimadas office coburn becomes so desperate to stall that he plays every card in his hand including personal secrets the red machine is deeper than it first seems the plot has hidden levels and so do the characters particularly the unlikely team of doyle and coburn they dont like each other and dont like working together and any possible personal progress is shut down by coburns fearsome reserve he is taciturn to the point of aggression neither actor overplays perkins role doesnt allow him thomscappellos thief is supposed to be brash and dubious which he is but within reason theres some subtle shifting going on that the directors suggest with visuals not dialogue an unspoken agreement to conspire takes place below the surface heres a film with an elegant simplicity not a shot doesnt do its work it may remind you of a 40s b crime movie and i mean that as a compliment when you dont have a lot of explosions and special effects to exploit you have to turn to the imagination  yours and the audiences

lin reshot some of the film including that ending but ive always thought it was a good one it shows an ability to separate achievement from morality and places so much value on success that it finally justifies any action lins young heroes i wrote in my article about the best films of the year have positioned themselves to take over from the fallen leaders of enron i thought about the film because the perfect score considers similar material without the bite and anger and savage determination it\s too palatable it maintains a tone of light seriousness and it depends on the caper for too much of its entertainment value better luck tomorrow also has a plot that involves crime but the difference is the perfect score is about the intended crime and depends on it while in better luck tomorrow we see a process by which the behavior of the characters leads them where they never thought to go there is a kind of franchising of movies going on right now in which the big studio product is like fast food bad for you but available on every corner good and challenging movies are limited to release in big cities and in a handful of independently booked cinemas whole states and sections of the country never see the best new films on big screens and theyre not always easy to find on video

110 minutes  the 1988 comedy by tim burton  but seeing this movie i realize how much more creatively burton used his special effects both movies are about strange evil creatures inhabiting a tricky haunted house and yet in the addams family the effects seem put in for their own sake to be looked at and are not really exploited in the story that leaves the individual moments yes a lot of them are funny in the months before this movie opened there were a lot of brief trailers for it in the theaters youve probably seen some of them  like the one where the kids ask if the girl scout cookies are made from real girl scouts by themselves these lines are funny as were the cartoon captions that inspired some of them but they dont build they get a laugh and then the movie has to build up to the next one this is the kind of film that isnt as much fun to see as it is to hear about

rated pg 98 minutes
 who uses the strongandsilent routine for all its worth it may be a cliche of a performance but it works and its interesting for once to find a movie indian who speaks in an indian language that has to be translated for the other characters he and the girl dawn wells  exchange many meaningful glances and mutual silences before the movies ending which is a happy one the exception in these cases theres a love interest but its underplayed and allowed to develop convincingly so we dont mind too much the movie works directly and doesn\t attempt to sneak allegories and messages past us that makes it all the more convincing after the lugubrious  the master gunfighter

suitable for adults why why is not a word you should bring with you to this movie pourquoi pas is it possible for two couples to swap mates without jealousy i doubt it the men are the problem when a husband is assured by his wife that he satisfies her just as much as the other man i submit to you theres not a husband on earth capable of believing that women are more trusting because sex is not the dominant theme in their life from age 13 to decrepitude all four people are attractive although vincent has too many tattoos for my taste he has a word in large letters running from one shoulder blade to the other in an unreadable typeface he must have found on the web my advice stick to helvetica the four lovers become best friends while effortlessly raising three children can this idyll last forever no one afternoon while theyre making love franck gets teri to help him shift her bed closer to the window for fengshui reasons they forget the time and when vincent returns home unexpectedly he is annoyed not to find them in bed together but to find the bed has been moved thats going too far when franck presses his wife to describe any of vincent\s problems the best she can do is report that sometimes he has trouble what say trouble getting an erection no getting over it if you see what i mean i can understand why this might be a problem for rachel but rachel honey it\s not what franck wants to hear

135 minutes is the joke on us is it our error to try to make sense of the film to try to figure out why protagonists change in midstream lets say it is lets say the movie should be taken exactly as is with no questions asked then what do we have we still have just the notes for isolated scenes theres no emotional or artistic thread running through the material to make it seem necessary that its all in the same film together the giveaway is that the characters have no interest apart from their situation they exist entirely as creatures of the movies design and conceits except for loggias gangster who has a reality however fragmentary luis bunuel  the spanish surrealist once made a film in which two actresses played the same role interchangeably in the appropriately titled  that obscure object of desire  1977 he made absolutely no attempt to explain this oddity one woman would leave a room and the other would reenter and so on

another good thing about the film surprisingly is the photography there\s one shot where the camera moves in and out of focus through a field of green grass and then steals slowly across one of the big brutal cycles the contrast has an impact equal to david lean\s similar shots in  doctor zhivago  remember the frosty window fading into the field of flowers there\s also good footage of the hell\s angels weaving down a highway as the zoom lens brings first one and then another into focus this accomplished camera work suggests that a documentary on cycles might be as poetic in its way as the treatment of surfing in  the endless summer

the way kurt spins his stories he\s always going off on wilderness enlightenment retreats and has just returned from ashland which he says was amazing tranformative i\m at a whole new place now really both kurt and mark behave as if they\d had this same conversation a million times before kurt is a flake  the kind of guy who sleeps on friends\ couches well into his 30s or 40s  but he\s also troubled by his inability to adapt to adulthood what does kurt want from mark is it lost brotherhood agape or is there a sexual component or does he just wish mark could give him back the old days and old joys of their younger selves those questions which linger long after the movie is over make old joy unshakable

134 minutes gary oldmans performance in the movie is the best thing about it sean penn is just as good an actor but he has the lead and theres not as much he can do with it he has to be sane and tortured and conflicted and battle with his opposing emotions all standard screenplay stuff oldmans character is more pure he acts only on the basis of his instincts and prejudices or out of vengeance and fear his character doesnt have to do the fancy footwork there are moments in the film that are absolutely chilling  as when ed harris who wanted to be at arms length from the crimes committed for his profit  finds that he has to personally kill someone he loves but the movies plot paradoxically gets less and less original the more complicated it becomes at the outset when it seems concerned only with the behavior of its characters its original and challenging then it turns into a story filled with familiar elements and by the end everything is happening by the numbers there\s another problem this movie intended as a gritty sliceoflife about gangsters in new york city is being released at about the same time as martin scorsese\s  goodfellas

86 minutes in these neighborhoods to wear the wrong gang colors in the wrong place at the wrong time is to risk being shot dead but a clown wears every possible color at once and in a way becomes disqualified the gangs sort of leave us alone one of the clowns says and there is a sense that joining a clown group may be a way to survive outside the gang culture it is also a very weird lifestyle we see clowns devising elaborate facial makeup owing more to batman villains than to bozo we witness artistic rivalries between various styles of clowning and dancing and there are suggestions that not everyone loves clowns while tommy is running the faceoff at the forum his home is trashed late in the film one of the most lovable characters is shot dead by driveby killers firing at random guns dont kill people people with guns kill people still rize on the whole brings good news of a radical social innovation that simultaneously sidesteps street gangs and bypasses hiphop krumping should turn up any day now on bet and mtv if it hasn\t already whether the dancers will be dressed as clowns is less likely there is something a little eerie about clowns and to see dozens of them at once perhaps inspires even gang members to go elsewhere

i felt a certain affection for the lovers on the bridge it is not the masterpiece its defenders claim nor is it the completely selfindulgent folly described by its critics it has grand gestures and touching moments of truth perched precariously on a foundation of horsefeathers so troubled was its distribution history that carax waited seven years to make another film which confirmed his unshakably goofy world view that was  pola x  which opened the 1999 cannes festival and was a modern telling of melville\s 19th century novel pierre about a young man\s idyllic relationship with his mother and his happy plans for marriage all destroyed by the appearance of a strange dark woman who claims to be his father\s secret daughter the movie exists outside the categories of good and bad i wrote from cannes it is a magnificent folly the lovers on the bridge on the other hand exists just inside the category of good i am not sure thinking about the two films that i don\t prefer pola x if you have little taste or discipline as a filmmaker but great style and heedlessness it may be more entertaining to go for broke than to fake a control you don\t possess

rated pg13 for sexrelated humor
92 minutes a lot of the movie consists of music much of it written by guest and other collaborators in the cast and that is an enjoyment and a problem the songs actually do capture the quality of the lesser groups of the time they are performed in uncanny imitations of early tv musical staging the movie demolishes any number of novelty songs with the folksmen\s version of eat at joe\s based on a faulty neon sign that reads e  a  o but there comes a point when the movie becomes  well performances and not comedy the final act of the movie mostly takes place during the televised concert and almost against its will takes on the dynamic of a real concert and not a satirical one there is another difficulty guest is rather fond of his characters he didn\t hate his targets in best in show or spinal tap but he skewered them mercilessly while the key characters in a mighty wind especially levy and o\hara take on a certain weight of complexity and realism that edges away from comedy and toward sincere soap opera there were many times when i laughed during a mighty wind not least at lines like the kind of infectious that it\s good to spread around but the edge is missing from guest\s usual style maybe it\s because his targets are after all so harmless the deluded spinal tap and the ferocious dog owners in best in show want to succeed and prevail the singers in a mighty wind are grateful to be remembered and as we watch them we cut them the kind of slack we often do for aging comeback acts hey the beach boys may be old fat and neurotic but we don\t want to spoil the fun by taking their tbird away

and yet cruz herself is lovable and charismatic and we can just about believe it when she walks down the street and hundreds of men follow her like sheep perrineau is lovable too he plays monica not as a stereotyped drag queen but as a character who carries his own comic weight in the movie the performance is all the more impressive since perrineau the narrator of hbo\s oz and the man killed by the bear in  the edge  is not a professional transvestite but is simply playing a roleso well he\s invaluable in every scene he\s in and steals his share but the story is a slow slog toward the obvious the evil tv execs are out of the recycled character department the brazilian husband is a convenience not a necessity the american producer is a dope and the movie plays its story so very safely that it sidesteps all the comic and romantic possibilities in the monica character shes more like a mascot when in a smarter movie she would have been the wild card

for thematic elements and some mild language 112 minutes
 found a winsome romanticism that bypasses the pragmatic side of life here he works with a story by alvin sargent that seems contrived from unlikely inspirations it is not enough to provide albert with whoopi goldberg as an aunt and gerard depardieu as an imaginary friend the movie also must allow harriet to see bogus tooand not just see him but dance the continental with him in the unlikeliest pas de deux of our age bogus is light as a feather its a charming inconsequential fantasy that sidesteps such matters as logic and motivation and rightly so this is the sort of beguiling fairy tale that needs as little reality as possible and i thought it really took off after the aunt finally saw bogus too a few problems are provided in the third act as when the homesick albert travels all by himself to atlantic city where mr antoine is performing and of course there are manufactured moments when it seems the little boy is missing or lost a crisis like that is necessary i suppose in order for there to be a happy ending

there is a reason for that cry freedom is not about biko it is woods\ story from beginning to end describing how he met biko how his thinking was changed by the man how he witnessed black life at first hand by patronizing a black speakeasy in a township and having a few drinks and how after he was placed under house arrest by the south africa government he engineered his escape from south africa the story has a happy ending woods and his family made it safely to england where he was able to publish two books about his experience the bad news is that biko was killed for the first half of this movie i was able to suspend judgment interesting things were happening the performances were good and it is always absorbing to see how other people live most of the second half of the movie alas is taken up with routine clockanddagger stuff including woods\ masquerade as a catholic priest his phony passport and his attempt to fool south african border officials these scenes could have been recycled out of any thriller from any country in any time right down to the ominous long shots of the men patroling the border bridge and the tense moment when the guard\s eyes flick up and down from the passport photo cry freedom is not really a story of today\s south africa and it is not really the story of a black leader who tried to change it like  all the presidents men  it\s essentially the story of heroic glamorous journalism remember that kirk douglas

well i suppose there\s something to be said for that point of view had russell made a good film and not said it was about tchaikovsky but the music lovers is libelous not only to the composer but to his music i am no composer lord knows but i have a notion that even the greatest of composers must have spent most of their time hard at work composing i doubt whether their great works came to them fullblown in moments of sexual religious political or sporting ecstasy i doubt whether any great work in any field of art comes to anybody great novels are not produced by automatic writing so why should great symphonies be russell apparently thinks they are and so although his film is more visually daring and more sexually explicit than other biographies of composers it rests on the same fallacious assumption that a sunset or a woman or a man in tchaikovskys case or a famous naval victory or something could inspire the composer to sit down and dash off a few inspired moments lest you accuse me of exaggerating let me just mention that tchaikovsky\s mental image when the cannons roar in the 1812 overture is supposed to be a friend\s head being blown off better we should have a movie in which russell\s image during the same passage is of his own head being blown off we would save the head for last of course in order to deal with lesser extremities of the minor works the music lovers is totally irresponsible then as a film about or inspired by or parallel to or bearing a vague resemblance to tchaikovsky his life and times it is not however a complete failure ken russell is a most deviously baroque director sucking us down with him into his ornate fantasies of decadent interior decoration until every fringe on every curtain has a fringe of its own and the characters have fringes too and the characters elbow their way through a grotesque jungle of candlesticks potted plant stands incense sticks old champagne bottles and gilt edges and it is almost certain that something is happening in the movie but what

rated r  is engaging intelligent and astonishingly sexy and both of them can play comedy especially with each other so wheres the flaw in the movie i think its in all of the apparatus that the screenplay erects around their lies although it is plausible that strangers would lie to each other and inevitable that a moment of truth would have to come bernstein and parent belabor the lies their characters tell until they become counterproductive up to a point we are able to believe that otoole believes short really lives in the vulgar apartment they visit but eventually the evidence against this particular lie becomes so inescapable that the screenplay can maintain the deception only by descending to the level of the idiot plot  the story device by which secrets are kept only because all of the characters are idiots there is another flaw i think at a point after most of otooles lies have been exposed but short still has a few left because the two characters like each other very much i thought the logical flow of the movie called for short to confess his deceptions instead he lashes out in anger at otoole while still trying to keep his own secrets the behavior is too hypocritical for a comedy

121 minutes it\s here the movie goes off the rails many of the details are wrong but i\ll mention just three is it likely that a young woman who has never committed a crime before would shoot a cop several times with little provocation is it likely that the gang\s disguises would look like fanciful mime makeup is it possible that several cops can be killed in an extended gun battle at a federal reserve bank without a quick police response more to the point is it likely that anthony\s life would lead to this sequence of events i don\t think so it\s as if the hughes brothers have led us into the wrong story i wanted to know more about anthony more about his thoughts and feelings i was reminded of oliver stone\s  born on the fourth of july  which also follows a young man into and out of vietnam and knows him so much better

107 minutes broomfield assembles a case charging that shakur was ordered killed by knight because the executive owed the singer unpaid royalties and had heard shakur planned to jump to another record label then he ordered bigs death in order to make the two murders seem like part of a fictitious east coastwest coast rap rivalry the film observes that suge knight had 30 to 40 lapd officers on his payroll for offduty bodyguard and other duties and he produces an lapd detective whose own investigation into the shakur murder was stonewalled leading to his resignation from the force if nothing else broomfield proves that the lapd bent over backward to avoid questioning the most obvious suspects there is another theory about the two murders developed in a long los angeles times investigation by chuck phillips published sept 6 2002 his findings in a nutshell shakur was killed by the crips street gang to avenge shakurs beating of one of their members and the gun used was supplied by the notorious big who agreed to pay the crips 1 million as for bigs death it remains unresolved whether either of these theories is correct is not my purpose to decide what can be said is that biggie  tupac is compulsively watchable and endlessly inventive as it transforms broomfield\s limited materials into a compelling argument broomfield himself is the star of the film complaining about his gas mileage forcing himself to listen to one of tupacs tapes complaining about his incompetent employees confessing to fear as he walks into dangerous situations there is something so disarming about the man as he persuades people to say things on camera that presumably could land them in trouble that no trouble has resulted from those things being said seems to support his argumentthat the killings were covered up within the lapd and there is no interest these days in being inconvenienced by any additional facts it goes without saying that the killings only enhanced the aura around rap music encouraging other artists to adopt the popular gangsta image

sometimes have a jodie foster sighting the movie suggests two directions that might fruitfully have employed by katherine dieckmann  the writer and director one is in the person of an east indian delivery man arjun gupta who begins an intriguing conversation with eliza indian americans are appearing in movies much more frequently  for one reason i suspect because we like their accents an indian friend told me we have been speaking english longer than you have could this meeting have been developed into a subplot the other direction might have been fundamental instead of jumping through hoops to make eliza somehow seem unique special and besieged by her utterly commonplace problems how about making her desperate with boredom and the desire to break out into the extraordinary maybe her blog dives off the high board and she becomes a media creature i dunno

87 minutes who is bean anyway like the little tramp he exists in a world of his own perhaps as a species of his own he combines guile and cluelessness he knows enough to use an electric razor on his face but not enough to refrain from also shaving his tongue he knows how to perform tasks but not when to stop can stuff a turkey but gets it stuck on his head and he is not in any sense lovable the movie gets a smile with macnicols attempt to tack on one of those smarmy moments where its observed that bean means well he doesnt mean well there are many moments here that are very funny but the film as a whole is a bit too long perhaps the halfhour tv form is the perfect length for bean when the art gallery episode has closed and the action shifts to a hospital operating room i had the distinct feeling that director mel smith was padding maybe theres a rule that all feature films must be at least 90 minutes long at an hour bean would have been nonstop laughs then they added 30 minutes of stops

danny boyle  producer andrew macdonald and writer john hodge  its a conventional movie that never convinces us that it needed to be made most films with angels depend more on supernatural intervention than character development but in this case the film seems completely confused about the nature the intervention should take and so are we the plots a mess the characters flail about in scenes without points and the more we see of cameron diaz and ewan mcgregor the more we yearn for a nice simple little love storysay about the rich girl who falls in love with the scots janitor and gets along just fine without any angels

all classic and airtight and handled by richet with economy and a sturdy clarity of action he doesnt go overboard with manic action scenes there are however a few plot points that confused me one is the way a forest seems to materialize near the station which seemed in an overhead shot to be in an urban wasteland my other problem is with a character who in order to be who he is and what he is would have to have known that bishop would end up at precinct 13 even though bishop clearly ends up there by accident oh and a tunnel turns up at a convenient moment as tunnels so often do problems like these amuse me with the nerve that is shown in trying to ignore them everybody is in a forest in the middle of downtown detroit ok then everybody can hide behind trees theyre running down a longforgotten sewage tunnel ok but not so forgotten that it doesnt have electric lights theres no way for that particular character to have prior knowledge of where bishop would be and no way for him to communicate plans that are essential to the outcome

malle is one of the lessknown french new wave directors although his zazie is a film society favorite and this film never received a us commercial release after its triumph at the 1964 new york film festival so it comes to us now as a rediscovered treasure a film that would have been influential for the past five years  if only it had been shown malles character seems superficially similar to fitzgerald himself he is a writer living in paris who lived in new york for a while but is now divorced from his wife there and he is an alcoholic whose addiction had undermined his confidence in his art and his manhood we find him living in a rest home where he voluntarily took the cure and then decided to stay he lives in a bemused and private world he speaks softly to himself he hums he moves silently about his room he toys with esoteric bricabrac he is preoccupied with the enormous thought of his own death urged by the doctor to leave because he is cured the writer goes to paris one day and systematically revisits several of his friends he drinks too much and makes a fool of himself at a party he questions the fundamental worth of his friends\ bourgeois existence finally he comes back to the home and hardly seeming moved even now kills himself

100 minutes fried green tomatoes  usually plays commonsensical sane characters this time she shows joon able to swing in an instant from calm to rage picking on little things that set her off it\s a convincing performance and aidan quinn in a somewhat thankless role as the movies reality base and opponent of love never plays a scene simply for its obvious point but lets us see that his love for his sister underlies all of his decisions benny and joon is a tough sell younger moviegoers these days seem to shy away from complexities which is why the movie and its advertising all shy away from any implication of mental illness the film is being sold as an offbeat romance between a couple of lovable kooks i was relieved to discover it was about so much more than that

like so many latin american stories this one has a certain smooth hypnotic charm there is more than magic and legend here there also is the feeling of predestination the feeling that the whole story was over long before it began to be told told in the wrong way where the river runs black could very easily seem silly but the director christopher cain  tells it with a dreamy inevitability and for me at least the spell worked cain\s first film was the stone boy a heartbreaking realistic film about a young boy who accidentially kills his brother with a shotgun and then must somehow live with the consequences this time cain once again uses silences and expressions and the looks in eyes to show us a young boy who has seen more than he can ever explain

young frankenstein  recycled the actual sets built for james whale\s the bride of frankenstein here frankenstein lives in a towering gothic castle just down the road from dracula and the mechanism lifts the monsters to unimaginable heights to expose him to lightning bolts there are also plentiful crypts stygian passages etc and a library in which a painting revolves perhaps in tribute to brooks\ revolving bookcase the screenplay by sommers has humor but restrains itself the best touches are the quiet ones as when the friar objects to accompanying van helsing but i\m not a field man he insists and when the monster somewhat unexpectedly recites the 23rd psalm at the outset we may fear sommers is simply going for fx overkill but by the end he has somehow succeeded in assembling all his monsters and plot threads into a highvoltage climax van helsing is silly and spectacular and fun

101 minutes vice versa  but hollywood has so downgraded its respect for the audience that the hot chick is now considered acceptable the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates jessica as clive becomes the best boygirlfriend a girl could want during a week in which the female jessica\s parents absentmindedly observe that she has been missing for days that a girl looking exactly like the most popular girl in high school is stripping and hooking escapes the attention of the local slackwits lessons are learned jessica sees things from a different point of view sweetness triumphs and the movie ends with one of those deleted scenes over the final credits this particular credit cookie is notable for being even more boring and pointless than the movie through superhuman effort of the will i did not walk out of the hot chick but reader i confess i could not sit through the credits the mpaa rates this pg13 it is too vulgar for anyone under 13 and too dumb for anyone over 13

120 minutes \xa0 would remotely suggest that there are just enough historical and political details the movie touches quickly on the fine points of britishfrenchindiansettler conflicts so that they can get on to the story we\re really interested in about the hero who wins the heart of the girl the last of the mohicans is not as authentic and uncompromised as it claims to be  more of a matinee fantasy than it wants to admit  but it is probably more entertaining as a result the scenes of forestfighting follow all the usual hollywood rules the hero rarely misses and the villains rarely hit anyone needed later in the story remembering the sickening thuds of weapon against bone in black robe i realized i was looking at a sanitized entertainment but i didn\t care

98 minutes unfortunately the film doesnt trust the relationships enough to go with them for a fulllength story maybe hollywood has lost faith in the possibility that interesting characters can sustain a featurelength movie all by themselves theres an unwritten law i guess that obligatory subplots have to be shoveled in and this one involves gangsters stolen money gambling hit men and the usual criminal rendezvous in the warehouse district since all of these scenes are plugged in from other movies the plot sometimes feels like its on automatic pilot but it comes alive at the crucial moments giving us a sense of what might have been does carvey have a future in movie comedy quite possibly on saturday night live he plays such broadly comic characters that you can\t see his sweet and engaging side but in opportunity knocks he\s more threedimensional like martin short  whose own snl caricatures obscured the human being beneath he\s an accomplished actor who can sell a real character i wish the screenplay had developed that side a little more and gone easier on the standard crime stuff

i like good horror movies they can exorcise our demons the texas chainsaw massacre doesn\t want to exorcise anything it wants to tramp crap through our imaginations and wipe its feet on our dreams i think of filmgoers on a date seeing this movie and then  what i guess they\ll have to laugh at it irony being a fashionable response to the experience of being had certainly they will not be frightened by it it recycles the same old tired thriller tools that have been worn out in countless better movies there is the scary noise that is only a cat the device of loud sudden noises to underline the movements of halfseen shadows the van that won\t start the truck that won\t start the car that won\t start the character who turns around and sees the slasher standing right behind her one critic writes best of all there was not a single case of \she\s only doing that falling going into a scary space not picking up the gun because she\s in a thriller\  huh nobody does anything in this movie for any other reason there is no reality here it\s all a thriller there is a controversy involving quentin tarantino\s kill bill volume 1 which some people feel is too violent i gave it four stars found it kind of brilliant felt it was an exhilarating exercise in nonstop action direction the material was redeemed justified illustrated and explained by the style it was a meditation on the martial arts genre done with intelligence and wit the texas chainsaw massacre is a meditation on the geekshow movie tarantino\s film is made with grace and joy this movie is made with venom and cynicism i doubt that anybody involved in it will be surprised or disappointed if audience members vomit or flee

who is the jigsaw killer and why has he gone to such diabolical lengths to devise such cruel predicaments well might you ask the answer of course is that he is a plot device lowered into the movie with a toolbox filled with horrors dangers and unspeakable choices he exists not because he has his reasons or motivations although some are assigned to him sort of as a courtesy at the end he exists because he tirelessly goes to great trouble and expense to fabricate a situation that the movie can exploit for 100 minutes and he is almost certainly not who he seems to be because of the screenwriting workshop principle that a false crisis and a false dawn must come before the real crisis and the real dawn elwes and whannell chained by their ankles in the locked room not only have to act their socks off but perhaps even their feet actors like roles like this i suppose because they can vibrate at peak intensity for minutes on end screaming and weeping and issuing threats and pleas and pretty much running through the gamut of emotions by knocking over all of the hurdles you hope at the end of the movie they have a hot shower a change of clothes and a chicken dinner waiting for them as for the possible jigsaw killer he of course is glimpsed imperfectly in some kind of a technotorture lair doing obscure things to control or observe the events he has so painstakingly fabricated we also see another version of the killer also annoying jigsaw or someone disguises himself as a grotesque clownlike doll on a tricycle uh huh whenever a movie shows me obscure partial oblique fragmented shots of a murderous mastermind or gives him a mask i ask myself  why since the camera is right there in the lair why not just show us his face the answer of course is that he is deliberately obscured because hes being saved up for the big revelatory climax at the end

the movie is incompetently made which is something of a surprise considering that it was directed by an old and good hand j lee the guns of navarone thompson transitions are ragged a lot of the dialog is inaudible and the rest is listless and the apes spend a lot of time sitting around discussing abstractions the battle footage looks cheap and the story is painfully thin battle looks like the last gap of a dying series a movie made simply to wring the dollars out of any remaining ape fans to a degree thats also the case with the new and ninth james bond movie  live and let die  but at least with that one some attempt was made to reproduce the technical gimmicks and wry eroticism of the earlier films in battle theres simply no reason at all for going anyone who hasnt had enough apes after the first four in the series has probably by now gone ape all by himself

the passion recut 2005 directed by
mel gibson rated not rated
if ever there was a film with the correct title that film is mel gibson\s \the passion of the christ\ although the word passion has become mixed up with romance its latin origins refer to suffering and pain later christian theology broadened that to include christ\s love for mankind which made him willing to suffer and die for us the movie is 126 minutes long and i would guess that at least 100 of those minutes maybe more are concerned specifically and graphically with the details of the torture and death of jesus this is the most violent film i have ever seen read eberts full fourstar review of the rrated version here

100 minutes theres too much of that for my taste but the movie depends mostly on wild exaggerations of 007 and here it does something right it shows stunts and special effects that look like they might have been staged in 1967 the film almost goes out of its way to reveal its using rear projection on a studio set the music is appropriate too that kind of cheesy pop that has a good time no matter whats happening onscreen the soundtrack reminded me of nothing so much as a forced laugh i sort of liked the 2006 film and i sort of like this one too i may like it a little more because dujardin grows on you the film opens with him singing everybody loves somebody in a voice that sounds so much like dean martin that maybe it is but the way he smiles and moves  well surely youve heard of the trololo man

aedin mincks  who wants ted now their desire is pitched at such a perverse level that it approaches teddybear predation what\s remarkable about ted is that it doesn\t run out of steam macfarlane seems unwilling to stop after the first payoff of a scene he keeps embellishing in ted he has an inexhaustible source of socially obnoxious behavior and language and it\s uncanny the way a teddy bear can get away with doing and saying things that we wouldn\t necessarily accept from a human character this is partly because ted is a standup insult comedian trapped inside the body of a teddy bear i must end on a note of warning ted is not merely an rrated movie but a very rrated movie  for crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug use according to the mpaa and what they mean by some is hard to figure because it could hardly contain more no matter how much kids want to see the teddy bear movie in the ads on tv steer them to  brave 
the rapture 1991 drama indie science fiction
rated r 92 minutes
the term religious film usually summons up pious banalities spoken by characters who have not had a thought in their lives most movies about the afterlife use the idea of heaven as a plot gimmick in stories about moonyeyed lovers who find each other because of a mistake in the celestial bookkeeping but the next world is not likely to be fuzzy and warm we live in a terrifying universe and christian theology read literally makes it more terrifying still after our allotted decades on earth during which we pass the time by eating drinking smoking having sex working watching tv going on vacations becoming sports fans and taking up hobbies we are suddenly catapulted into a realm where we will spend eternity in either infinite bliss or infinite misery if we lived in full belief and full consciousness of such an eternity surely life would drive us mad the risk of damnation would be too great to allow a moment\s relaxation and indeed some of the saints seem to have been deranged by such fears their insanity passing for holiness the great courageous act of tolkin\s the rapture is to consider such questions in a film that is not overtly religious at all he is not trying to proselytize or convert his viewers and indeed i imagine some believers will be quite offended by this film what he is doing from a secular point of view is examining the logic of the final judgment as radically and uncompromisingly as he can

for graphic war injuries and some sensuality 115 minutes
chooses not to reflect those conditions and so when ernest and agnes make love for the first time in the little pensione down by the railroad station it is a conventional movie scene not one specific to these characters i wanted this to be the most beautiful place on god\s earth\\ he says realizing the pensione is little more than a brothel then close your eyes\\ she says hemingway would have been reaching for his blue pencil then again maybe not as the earth shook i am always suspicious of stories that take on significance because of events that happen after they\re over    and that little boy grew up to begeorge washington\\ in love and war\\ is not much interested in ernest hemingway\s subsequent life and career and even in its treatment of this early period it doesn\t deal with themes such as his macho posturing his need to prove himself his grandiosity hemingway creates a more interesting and selfrevealing character in his own stories of the war

94 minutes the movie has an eerie kind of fascination even though its message is scary bronson and winner have worked together on several films and they\ve perfected the bronson persona he\s a steely instrument of violence with few words and fewer emotions in death wish we get just about the definitive bronson rarely has a leading role contained fewer words or more violence and winner directs with a cool precision hes one of the most efficient directors of action and violence his muggings and their surprise endings have a sort of inevitable rhythm to them were set up for each one almost like the gunfights in westerns theres never any question of injustice because the crimes are attempted right there before our eyes and then bronson becomes judge and jury and executioner    spoiler alert    thats whats scary about the film its propaganda for private gun ownership and a call to vigilante justice even the cops seem to see it that way bronson becomes a folk hero as the new york vigilante and the mugging rate drops fifty percent so the police want to catch bronson not to prosecute him for murder but to offer him a deal get out of town stay out of town and well forget this bronson accepts the deal and in the movies last scene we see him taking an imaginary bead on a couple of goons in chicago

the big easy  1987 was oscar caliber and again this time she seems to cross some kind of acting threshold when she roughly embraces pacino and then stalks around the room like a tigress in heat before returning to her quarry there is an energy that almost derails the movie for pacino sea of love is a reminder of the strong presence he established in street roles in the 1970s before he drifted away into an unfocused stardom in too many softer roles this time he seems sharp edgy complicated and authentic goodman who plays roseanne barr\s husband on tv makes a good partner for him especially in the scenes where he stands by helplessly while his friend apparently chooses to be in love with a murderess movies like this need to work on two levels the human elements should feel right and the initial complications of the plot should not be shortchanged at the end i think the ending of sea of love cheats by bringing in a character from left field at the last moment part of the fun in a movie like this is guessing the identity of the killer and part of the problem with sea of love is that the audience is not fairly treated technically i suppose the plot can be justified but i felt cheated i had good feelings for the characters and their relationships but i walked out feeling the plot played fast and loose with the rules of whodunits

102 minutes  is another weak point hes not much of an actornot here anyway in material that would have defeated anybodybut the movie doesnt even try to make his character interesting that would upstage the stars i guess an indication of the movies lack of ambition is its use of runaway cliches his girlfriend has run off with a rock singer he follows her crystal and williams follow him into the mosh pits of rock concerts and to the bands engagement in reno etc theres even a gratuitous drug dealer hauled into the plot so he can threaten the kid about a missing 5000 would it have been too much to motivate the kid with something besides sex drugs and rock n roll do we need a drug dealer in this innocuous material and what about poor julia louisdreyfus  she has the thankless role of crystals wife when crystal and williams drag the kid into a hotel room for a shower she misunderstands everything she hears on the phone and thinks her husband is showering with strange men and boys later she turns up while hes telephoning her and he talks into the phone not realizing her answers are coming from right behind him this will be hilarious to anyone who doesnt know how telephones work the people connected with this movie are among the brighter talents in hollywood ivan reitman

97 minutes this movie would not have been made quite the same way 10 or 20 years ago the focus would have been on the liberalism of the white woman and the courage of the black woman and most of the scenes would have involved the white family the long walk home takes the time to develop both families to show that in addition to being heroic but abstract media images the maids like odessa were also individuals with all the usual human hopes and worries not least of which was losing a job because the movie does center some of its important scenes inside the black household it\s all the more surprising that it uses the gratuitous touch of a white narrator  apparently to reassure white audiences the movie is really intended for them the narrator is spacek\s teenage daughter who has no role of any importance in the movie and whose narration adds nothing except an unnecessary point of view when she talks about her memories of my mother we want to know why goldberg\s daughter doesn\t have equal time she probably has more interesting memories that objection aside the long walk home is a powerful and affecting film so well played by goldberg and spacek that we understand not just the politics of the time but the emotions as well in a way this movie takes up where  driving miss daisy  leaves off both are about affluent white southern women who pride themselves on their humanitarian impulses but who are brought to a greater understanding of racial discrimination  gently tactfully and firmly  by their black employees

who once played mike tyson on tv makes a powerful spawn with a presence both menacing and touching and clown is an inspired villain with one wicked oneliner after another you\re jimmy stewartand i\m clarence\\ but the sheen and williamson characters exist primarily just to nudge the plot along and theresa randle\s wife is underwritten we want more about her feelings so the way to view the movie i think is to consider the story as the framenecessary but upstaged by what it contains which in this case is some of the most impressive effects i\ve seen the disciplines blend into one another animation makeup costuming process shots morphing they create a place and a look as specific as the places evoked in such films as metropolis and  blade runner

theres also a problem with renee  kerry washington  kallen\s best friend who becomes luther\s girlfriend i think i say i think because the role is so seriously underwritten that the movie would have been better off just not including it although luther and kallen are never romantically attracted theirs is the movie\s central relationship dutton working from a screenplay by cheryl edwards  doesnt seem much interested in luthers private emotional life and so we get inexplicable scenes in which luther and renee seem to be best friends or are hanging out together or  what the two of them have hardly any dialogue with each other and although renee is cheering during the big fight theres no scene resolving her feelings for her man the spotlight is on kallen which is all right but it leaves a loose end

95 minutes the story of 84 charlie mopic is not original nor was it meant to be anyone who has seen a fair number of war films will recognize the various types of characters in the platoon  the natural leader the newcomer the scared youngster  but what is original to this film is the sense of reality that duncan is able to recapture the types are familiar but what happens to them is not predictable and the story takes the sudden unexpected turns of real warfare rather than the manufactured developments of a hollywood plot as the patrol gets lost in the central highlands of vietnam and finds itself in deeper and deeper trouble we begin to feel the senselessness of their mission their training helps them only to a point and then they are in the hands of luck or fate all of this is seen through the eyes of mopic the cameraman and what makes his subjective camera convincing is that he is not simply recording the action but trying to make a documentary that can be used as a training film for other infantrymen the six members of the reconnaissance unit are more or less experienced in the field and they share their experience and lore with the camera its like giving a briefing to trainees the film is filled with dozens of tiny details that only a field veteran like duncan would know about the danger of smoking for example when cigarettes can be smelled on the wind for hundreds of yards and instantly identified as american tobacco this kind of minutiae somehow adds up to more suspense than any number of mysterious shadows in the jungle the subjective camera is probably responsible for many of the weaknesses of 84 charlie mopic as well as its strengths duncan knows more about war than he knows about dramatic construction and this shows in the way he builds the various relationships in the movie

braveheart  wouldn\t you think no such luck besson\s film is a thin uninvolving historical romp in which the only juicy parts are played by supporting characters such as the dauphin made by john malkovich into a man whose interest in the crown essentially ends with whether it fits faye dunaway has fun as his stepmother yolande daragon who schemes against joan as any mother would when her son falls under the sway of a girl from the wrong side of the class divide and dustin hoffman is really very good as the inquisitor even if his role seems inspired by the desperate need to somehow shoehorn philosophy into the film i was reminded of the roger corman

8 everyone in the audience knows marie antoinette was beheaded and i fear we anticipate her beheading with an unwholesome curiosity coppola brilliantly sidesteps a beheading and avoids bloated mob scenes by employing light sound and a balcony to use maries death as a curtain call hired essentially to play a princess she is a good trouper and faithful to her role it is impossible to avoid thoughts of diana princess of wales 9 every criticism i have read of this film would alter is fragile magic and reduce its romantic and tragic poignancy to the level of an instructional film 10

several of the characters seem to have extreme emotional myopia especially masters who arrives at adams apartment one evening to find her on the floor locked in an embrace with stern masters does not mention this event to them or indeed even seem to notice it the characters also have short memories not long after masters has had a cruel and bitter argument with adams she seems glad to see him as if the fight had not occurred there also is an extremely unlikely scene in which masters uses his bicycle to chase the limousine carrying adams and roberts to the airport its the kind of development that belongs in a road runner cartoon these trials and tribulations are played out against a backdrop of adult toys including a lot of bicycles masters and stern are bicycle racers and spend a lot of time speeding through central park in training for the big manufacturers hanover bank bike race which almost but not quite supplies the climax for the movie

110 minutes the story he tells here of a real woman named marie latour is well known in france where she was one of the last three women to receive the death penalty the latour case obviously fascinates chabrol perhaps because he does not know what her true motivations were she began in poverty and was able to thrive and flourish under the nazi occupation she bought furs and kept a lover she was not a liberated woman in any sense and did not see her role as an abortionist as a brave or necessary one but simply as a profitable and even inevitable route to a larger income nor did the government really see her as a criminal the prosecution in the film is shown as devoid of moral outrage but obsessed by the need to set an example the whole episode seems to have unfolded without anyone really feeling much of anything  anyone except for the family of a desperate mother of six who dies after one of marie\s abortions today the collaborationist government is reviled in france abortion is legal and paid for by the government and marie latour is dead what is chabrol\s message he does not say his film is as opaque as his character story of women is a morality play without a conclusion we have to make up our own minds most movies on themes like this instruct us about how to think by portraying its characters as good or bad and casting them to seem attractive or otherwise chabrol does not make it so easy

the movies structure qualifies it as a fairly traditional road picture we get the series of little towns and sunsets and traffic signs and motels and fast food joints that look about the same in alabama as anywhere but the stops along the way are a lot more perceptive than they usually are in road movies and in particular theres an encounter with a disk jockey that develops genuine corruption maury acting as straight as he can despite the speed visits the dj in his studio and brings along a quart of wild turkey as a gift why maury i see youve brought me some wild game the dj snickers then follows lowkey blackmail in which the dj tries to talk maury into returning on monday for a local fundraiser and maury tries to talk his way out of it and they both implicitly acknowledge the payola aspect of the whole deal its a perfectly observed scene theres another sequence in which maury dumps one of his groupies at roadside drives off returns drives off again and then returns again to describe exactly what hes up to would destroy the scene but its funny and very hurtful both at once duke uses these road scenes to build up a portrait of a man who is deeply cynical especially about himself and who uses his little power to protect himself from a world which has so much more in the end it turns out he isnt powerful enough theres a murder  quick accidental almost a surprise  and maury gets his driver to take the rap for him itll be self defense anyway but maury has to make the birmingham concert and then his life starts closing in on him his problems refuse to stay buried his desperation turns into rage he has come to the end of the line and he cant fix things anymore  not this time his manager says when he tries to get rid of a cop the movies ending provides not so much a tragedy as a deliverance for maury and payday is very good at making us see why

 given the success of the hollywood remake of la cage aux folles we may actually be seeing casting like this before long at least two of pignons coworkers are intrigued by the revelations about his sexuality mlle bertrand  michele laroque  his superior found him boring when he was straight but sexy now that hes gay and wants to seduce him and the rugbyplaying santini who picked on pignon when he thought he was a sissy tries to save his own job by taking the accountant out to lunch and being nice to himsuspiciously nice some might think the movie passes the time pleasantly and has a few good laughs the loudest is when pignon rides in a gay pride parade wearing a crown that looks like a jolly giant condom but the screenplay relies too much on the first level of its premise and doesnt push into unexpected places once we get the setup we can more or less anticipate the sitcom payoff and there arent the kinds of surprises reversals and explosions of slapstick that made la cage aux folles so funny in the rating system of the michelin guide its worth a look but not a detour or a journey

well one of the problems with his message is that it is not based on fact it\s a fantasy even though it may be true that the multinational oil companies try to manipulate the energy market it is apparently not true that a formula exists that could turn coal into cheap synthetic fuel yet the movie\s publicity calls the existence of a secret nazi formula a proven fact i have here an article from the november 1980 issue of science magazine noting that the synthesis used by the germans are more in the nature of textbook processes than mobil secrets and that the film as history is bunkum if the film cannot be taken seriously as an expose and it is hopelessly confused as a thriller whats left two marvelous performances scott as the detective is a harried tired deeply cynical man who fills the crevices of his role with actors details that make the cop a human being brando who modeled his makeup to resemble occidental oil\s armand hammer has a great speech at the end of the film and several other classic lines ranging from you\re missing the pointwe are the arabs to the succinct offer milk dud

114 minutes  when elizabeth hears this news blanchett rises to full fury in an awesome example of regal jealousy she desired raleigh for herself of course although there is no evidence that in life she had such feelings for him some of the films best scenes involve mary played by samantha morton as a heroic and devout woman who goes to the executioners ax with dismay but royal composure elizabeths own crisis of conscience over marys death is also well played but the film is far more interested in romantic intrigue and sea battles i think it undervalues the ability of audiences to get involved in true historical drama instead of recycled action cliches the costumes and settings are nearly overwhelming reviewing the earlier film i suggested that shekhar kapur was perhaps influenced by the rich colors and tapestries of his native india here he seems carried away by them there are scenes where the elaborate lace on elizabeths costume is so detailed and flawless that we dont think about the character we wonder how long blanchett must have had to stand there while holding the pose and not ruffling anything

penelope ann miller  and a parallel story involving the vicious drug dealer and his mom and a journey to the small town for the obligatory but quite effective violent climax reitman juggles the light stuff the heartwarming scenes the comedy and the violence with endless invention so that the movie doesnt seem to be shifting gears even when it is movies like this are often no stronger than their villains and tyson and baker make a scary and effective team hes a spoiledrotten mothers pet who has never grown up and whose love for his son is basically narcissistic she is a bitch on wheels the other key performances are also effective and it was interesting to observe while seeing the movie in a large audience what genuine affection the public has for schwarzenegger he has a way of turning situations to his advantage and creates an entertaining relationship with his young students in this movie warning this is not a film appropriate for smaller children despite the title and the ad campaign which make it look like a sweet and jolly fun fest the movie contains images sure to be terrifying to gradeschoolers such as a man setting the school on fire small children kidnapped and terrorized a father slapping his child and so forth in context and for mature viewers the scenes have a purpose and the movie works but itll be nightmare time for smaller children who see it

i also had some problems with the film\s visual strategy the director steve spaz williams has a way of cutting on dialogue to unexpected closeups that gives us a subtle feeling that the movie knows in advance what will happen next when in theory it should seem to find out just when we do i also think the framing of some of the characters is too close they hog the foreground and obscure the background and the fur hair and feathers on the creatures look so detailed thanks to the wonders of cgi that once again we\re wandering toward the uncanny valley an animated film can approach reality but it should never arrive there it must always seem one magical arm\slength away the art is in the style in the way reality is distorted or heightened when miyazaki gives us characters who shout so loudly we can see their tonsils he knows what he\s doing none of these details will matter to the target audience for the wild of course although maybe in some vague unconscious way they will sense that the movie doesn\t have that je ne sais quoi i phrase i employ again to make you feel vindicated for looking it up in the first place as french phrases go it is one of the handiest and especially useful when you dont know quite what to say

ive been looking at a lot of films noir lately  those stylish black and white crime movies from the 1940s in which evil was found to lurk just below the surfaces of ordinary american lives things change is a film in which the surface is evil and goodness lurks beneath the strangest thing about the film is the way the bond between the ameche and prosky characters seems to redeem the nevada boss to convince him if only for an afternoon that the real reason he got into crime was in order to demonstrate his loyalty to his friends if there is a flaw in the movie it is mamet deliberation a clever movie should always be quicker than its audience and here there are moments when we have time to see ahead into the plot mamet has a genuine gift for movie direction  his films are not just illustrations of his dialogue but have an energy of their own  however timing is the area where he needs to tinker his dialogue for the stage is written in such a way that an actor reading it is almost forced to time it the way mamet imagined it his characters punctuate their sentences by repeating the same words and phrases for emphasis but in the movies words exist in a different kind of time than on the stage and mamet tends to take play around and find what works for his dialogue the performances here are all wonderful especially ameche working in the midst of a cast that is otherwise entirely drawn from the mamet stock company he finds just the right note of bewilderment and cleverness the character is never other than a confused old italian shoeshine man and yet time and again he saves himself by somehow finding the right thing to say mantegna as his keeper walks a fine line between desperation and comedy  and isnt afraid to go broader in scenes where he pantomimes what ameche should be saying and doing and prosky his face a mask of jovial cunning is touching in the way he wants to believe in this stranger who is so apparently phony things change is a delicate balance of things that dont easily go together farce wit violence and heart here they do

94 minutes the movie benefits by looking vaguely historically accurate it used the sets build by lord lew grade for franco zeffirelli\s jesus of nazareth it incorporates familiar figures such as pontius pilate  michael palin  but observes that he speaks with a lisp his centurions helplessly crack up behind his back at crucial moments he breaks into song and there is a particular irony considering how it is used on the movie that the bright side of life has taken on a long life in exactly the opposite context if the film has a message and it may its that much of what passes in religion for truth is the result of centuries of opinion and speculation its version of the brian legend is like a comic parallel to the theories of christian history in the da vinci code

journey of hope concerns a persistent pattern of immigration that mirrors in europe the northward drift of american black people in the years after world war i but it does not give much of the larger view and never deals with the fact that germany switzerland the scandinavian countries and other rich nations actually need these poor cheap southerners to do menial jobs that the locals disdain the film prefers a tighter focus on this one family its journey and its fate and at the end it is difficult to say what lesson has been learned their experience itself reminded me of  the grapes of wrath  another story of a family on the road toward an elusive mirage of economic security there is enormous potential here but the film does not quite pay off and the crucial decisions taken at each stage of this story are often so stupid and foolhardy that we despair this family is taking such chances we feel that only the gods can save it and the gods do not seem to care

rated r 123 minutes
climbing a straightup pillar in monument valley now i wouldnt say im afraid of heights but i am ah well sometimes a little queasy at the thought of standing on the edge of a 3000 foot drop and the photography of this sequence is fine at inspiring vertigo it ends with a helicopter shot showing eastwood and kennedy all alone on top of the column like so many of the shots in the movie its obviously unfaked in many climbing movies the actors are actually clinging to rock faces about six inches off the ground or stunt doubles are used for the tricky parts and then we cut to a closeup of the star not here eastwood actually does his own climbing and the photography insists on that with a lot of long shots that unmistakably establish his position and altitude before zooming in to show us its eastwood that makes the danger in the mountain scenes seem more real weve vicariously more involved with the actual eastwood than we would be with hollywood stunt work no matter how impressive and so we get wrapped up in the situations and were seduced by the photography and we enjoy the several pretty girls who happen along in the heros path and if the plot doesnt make any sense well no movies perfect

the brooke smith character is the bestdrawn and most clearly seen and as she walks into a convenience store and starts blasting away we notice the reactions of the bystanders they understand they know this is only tv they are not horrified but intrigued and they\re no doubt wondering am i on now the overlap between this behavior and some of the actions during the san diego school shooting a week ago are uncanny and disturbing the kid who went back into the school with the video camera was interviewed recently about how much he had been interviewed real life has caught up with series 7 and lapped it the movie was filmed before the first airing of a survivor episode and must have seemed more radical in the screenplay stage than it does now we observe that the writerdirector daniel minahan  has a good feel for the slick graphics and theme songs of this brand of tv and knows how the bumpers and the teasers work but the movie has one joke and tells it too often for too long it leaves you with time to think about television celebrity and shame remind me to tell you sometime about the other guests on that springer episode

173 minutes the film covers more than 30 years enough to show us how people change and how marriages must change to accommodate them one of the most startling scenes comes when jean volunteers for the first world war and pauline visiting him near the front finds him a crude rough man shoveling food into his mouth made gross by the hard life of the trenches later he returns slowly to civilization and even to tenderness symbolized by a sunny afternoon in their orchard which both remember as a blessed moment social currents thrust into the complacency of the barnery family it faces strikes marxist organizers competition from cheap german goods the film is remarkable in the way it gains epic sweep without ever descending into the merely picturesque these are always people living in a real worldexcept for one scene toward the beginning where pauline stars at a formal dance her head turning left and then right as she sweeps through the room beart always beautiful has never looked more radiant and jean barnery agrees as long as the film is there are loose ends in the dance scene for example pauline is approached by dahlias remi martin an uglyhandsome man who inspires much gossip he is attracted to her stands too close speaks with too much familiarity violates her space creates a threat excites our interest and then disappears from the movie there is also the sense of something missing in the transition of the daughter aline from an adolescent who is scandalously seen everywhere to a young woman who takes the vows of a deaconess and walls herself from the world but nothing is missing in the central relationship jean lives according to his driven inner codes and pauline who loves him cannot make him happier but she is able to bring him a perfect example of his new design of china and spread it on the counterpane of his death bed their marriage is not perfect but it endures and stands for something this is not a movie about episodes but about the remorseless bookkeeping of life which sends such large payments so early and collects so much interest at the end

the parents accidentally find out the identities of the killers because of a stolen locket and some bloodstained clothing in their baggage enraged the father takes on the gang singlehandedly and murders them does any of this sound familiar think for a moment setting aside the modern details this is roughly the plot of ingmar bergman\s the virgin spring the story is also based on a true incident we\re told at the beginning of the movie but i have my doubts i think the producers may simply be trying one of those only the names have been changed capers what does come through in last house on the left is a powerful narrative told so directly and strongly that the audience mostly in the mood for just another good old exploitation film was rocked back on its psychic heels wes craven\s direction never lets us out from under almost unbearable dramatic tension except in some silly scenes involving a couple of dumb cops who overact and seriously affect the plot\s credibility the acting is unmannered and natural i guess there\s no posturing there\s a good ear for dialogue and nuance and there is evil in this movie not bloody escapism or a thrill a minute but a fully developed sense of the vicious natures of the killers there is no glory in this violence and craven has written in a young member of the gang again borrowed on bergman\s story who sees the horror as fully as the victims do this movie covers the same philosophical territory as sam peckinpah\s  straw dogs

the sex scenes are the best ones in the movie not because of the sex where bartel and wagner could have actually been more satirical but because of the dialogue leading up to and away from the sexual encounters this dialogue at least sounds and feels as if it has been generated by the moment the rest of the dialogue in the movie sounds arch contrived and written and most of the time we don\t believe that the characters would really be saying it example ride me    ride your sad little private pony straight down into hell the ghostly husband played by mazursky inspires distractions that are not helpful to the movie for one thing we are reminded that mazursky directed  down and out in beverly hills

so back to ally walker if you go to this movie watch her carefully she is given an absurd character to play but she has a screen personality that implies wit and intelligence even when the dialogue provides her with nothing to work with she has some of the same qualities as debra winger  and brings scenes to life simply through the energy of her presence to my astonishment i found myself interested in what she was saying and if she can sell this dialogue she can play anything as for lundgren and van damme it must be fairly thankless to play lunks who have to fight for the entire length of a movie while exchanging monosyllabic idiocies at the cannes film festival in may the two stars found themselves on the same red carpet going up the formal staircase to an evening screening they exchanged words and got into a shoving match right there in front of the worlds tv cameras some said it was a publicity stunt i say if you can do one thing and do it well stick to it 
time bandits 1981 adventure comedy family fantasy foreign mystery science fiction thriller
rated pg 110 minutes
lingered lovingly over a walkon as the supreme\r\nbeing i had to sort things out and i was helped enormously in that process by\r\nthe review of time bandits by stanley kauffmann in the new republic he\r\ndescribes the film unblinkingly as a children\s movie of\r\ncourse there have been so many elaborate bigbudget\r\nfantasies in recent years from raiders to  superman  to clash of the\r\ntitans that weve come to assume that elaborate costume fantasies are aimed\r\nat the average eighteenyearold filmgoer who is trying to recapture his\r\nadolescence these movies have a level of limited sophistication and\r\nwickedness that is missing in time bandits but perhaps time bandits does\r\nwork best as just simply a movie for kids i ran it through my mind that way\r\nwondering how a kid would respond to the costumes the panoply the explosions\r\nthe horses and heroic figures and of course the breathless nonstop pacing\r\nand i decided that a kid would like it just fine im not sure thats what\r\ngilliam had in mind but it allows me to recommend the moviewith\r\nreservations but also with admiration

 whose credits include major league 1989 he makes all the pieces fit and the onfield action looks convincing but there\s a certain thinness in some of the characters the coach for example is made by caan into a man without much depth his function is to move the plot along with lots of furrowed brows and lip twitches and lattimer the musclebound animal comes across more as a world wrestling federation stooge than a plausible college student he illustrates team spirit by breaking car windows with his forehead still the movies human scenes are appealing  especially the moment when darnell finally believes his beautiful tutor loves him and the movie seems expert on how a lineman could pump himself full of steroids and still pass the ncaa drug tests although some of his methods for providing clean urine are too painful to contemplate

that said whatever it was alvin and the chipmunks is about as good as a movie with these characters can probably be and i am well aware that i am the wrong audience for this movie i am even sure some readers will throw it up to me like i liked the garfield movie better yes but garfield didn\t sing and he was dubbed by bill murray  my duty as a reporter is to inform you that the chipmunks are sorta cute that jason lee and david cross manfully play roles that require them as actors to relate with empty space that would later be filled with cgi and that at some level the movie may even be doing something satirical about rock stars and the hype machine i was also grateful that alvin wears a red sweater with a big a on it as an aid to identification since otherwise all the chipmunks seem to be identical like mutant turtles or spice girls

walking\rout of mother night i asked myself what statement exactly the movie had\rmade i could not answer campbell is a man without a country without core\rbeliefs it is impossible to say for sure which side he was on and which side\rhe harmed more he was a man prepared to take the most convenient course and\rfor him the ability to stay in germany and become a famous propagandist wined\rand dined by top nazis was very convenient especially if he could pass along\rsecret messages for the americans which was convenient too the\rconvenience for campbell ended when the nazis lost the war since the americans\rwere never going to claim him it would have been more convenient if germany\rhad won i assume in that case that campbell would have stayed in germany\rwould have been celebrated as a hero and eventually would have been given a plum\rjob the dilemma vonnegut sets him is that he cannot jump off the ship it was\rconvenient for him to sail through the war on vonnegut\rwants to show us a man very much like most of us no smarter no braver who\rdoes what he does because it will contribute to his comfort and perhaps to his\rsurvival there but for the grace of god go we drifting through life having\rbenefitted from chance and convenience hoping the day will not come when we\rhave to risk everything by declaring ourselves it takes an extraordinary man\rto stand outside his tribe and try to see what is objectively good and right\rcampbell was not within miles of being that man does\rthe film work not really it loses itself in comic caricatures of the loonies\rthat campbell meets in new york and its melodramatic doublereverses by\rmaking the plot seem arbitrary rob it of importance nor does the film within\ritself make clear what it thinks we can think about it afterwards and that\ris instructive but mother night is like notes for a lecture that is not\rcompleted

111 minutes there are a few scenes of great power including one where the brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day his wife expresses her concern through the medium of the dish she has cooked and then the mafia boss makes an unexpected visit there is also a strong although curiously tentative late scene between the mayor and his deputy one scene handled with subtlety involves the mayors decision to speak at the funeral of the slain child in a harlem church his advisers tell him he wont be welcome there but he goes anyway and cranks himself up for an oration of unashamed rhetoric it gets a good response from the congregation but the mayor knows and his deputy knows that it was phony and the way they carefully avoid discussing it in the limousine taking them away is a delicate use of silence and evasion pacino and cusack are effective together throughout the movie  the older man wise and tough the younger one eager to learn but with principles that dont bend many of the parts of city hall are so good that the whole should add up to more but it doesn\t the subplot involving the lawyer played by fonda is not necessary and leads to an extended sequence where fonda and cusack travel by train to buffalo in the snow as the movie\s momentum is lost and the shamelessly upbeat final scene showing the cusack character running for office feels false to all that\s gone before  as if the movie was judged too gloomy and false cheer was tacked on good films deserve to end with scenes involving what they are about not what they are not about

the abels are no strangers to hoaxes even on a national scale in 1963 you may recall they perpetrated the society for indecency to naked animals which had as its goal panties for every dog and a brassiere for every cow chapters were established at several campuses and no end of st bernard fraternity mascots sulked around looking sheepish in their bvds before the society was unmasked is there sex after death is not alas up to this level of social satire but it does allow a breath of fresh air to permeate the world of xrated pornography if there\s one discouraging thing about our national appetite for pornography it\s the lack of any humor in our approach to it for every reader of the national lampoon there are three dozen dirty old men who sit joyless and beadyeyed through crummy porno flicks in fact most pornography is hilarious if you view it in the right spirit all you need is a welldeveloped sense of the ridiculous which is what the abels have they do not have a welldeveloped sense of film editing however and so their movie is too long and repeats itself still there are moments that transcend themselves as in the interview with the proud director of the world\s first xrated animal movie it stars a goose and a donkey he explains can you imagine the months of training necessary to bring the world a few seconds of screen magic next i guess we can look forward to the world\s first male pig chauvinist pig

in jinxed by thinking of his dog and maybe brown just couldn\t express the feelings that were in the script but i was never really convinced that he cared for davis that\s less of a handicap later in the movie however when the brown character is required to draw back from any involvement with this pathetic street kid the relationships in winter of our dreams are very tangled  maybe too tangled brown\s character has been married for six years to gretel kathy downes a handsome smart woman who has a lover they have an open marriage and there\s no objection when brown brings davis home for the night davis taking this all in can\t understand it trying to learn how to feel again she can\t understand why anyone would deliberately trivialize his feelings the key passages in the film involve browns discovery that davis is a heroin junkie and then her tortured period of drug withdrawal they are both pretending to care for one another and after davis gets straight maybe brown will become her lover while his wife disappears into the woodwork that is not however even remotely in the cards and theres a painful scene during a party at browns house where davis realizes that brown is very married open marriage or not there seem to be two movements in winter of our dreams one is davis\ movement away from the cynicism and despair of prostitution and back toward an ability to care for another person the other is brown\s initial concern for this girl and then his retreat back into his shell davis performs her movement magnificently brown didn\t win my sympathy for a moment what just barely saves this film is the fact that we\re not supposed to like the brown character as for davis she\s a wonder

you dont ask questions like that you accept the genre it consists of people being horribly sucked up and digested and having their teeth fillings spit out the interest would seem to be in the special effects what do the things really look like i saw the 1951 film with my mother in a movie theater in west point ny where we were attending my cousin tommys graduation from the military academy it was the most terrifying experience i have ever had in a movie theater what did the creature look like im not quite sure i know it was played by james arness and was humanoid a guy in a thing suit you could say the point wasnt its appearance it was the suspense the long cold corridors of the antarctic structure the dark and cluttered store rooms could be concealing a thing that would leap out at you characters persisted in wandering off recklessly by themselves i kept ducking down behind my seat the contribution by john carpenter was to take advantage of three decades of special effects to make his creatures awful gooey things from space that was done well in his film and it is done with even more technical expertise here  but to what point the more you see of a monster the less you get it is the unseen the imagined that scares you this version of the thing directed by matthijs van heijningen jr provides such graphic and detailed views of the creature that we are essentially reduced to looking at special effects and being aware that we are think how little you ever really saw in the first alien movie and how frightening it was

a lot of the movie is shall we say not convincing i was personally certain that i would never again see jack lemmon or james garner leaping from a moving train but i was wrong chase scenes involve the usual assortment of ontheroad types including a colorful female truck driver an elvis imitator illegal immigrants and the dykes on bikes motorcycle club these scenes are familiar from many another film whats entertaining however is the way the movie skewers the human weaknesses of the two old presidents its funny when lemmon collects a big paycheck for giving a speech before a japanese insurance company and finds himself dancing with the company mascot a giant panda its funny when garner agrees to write his memoirs mostly in the hopes of sleeping with his sexy book editor its funny when lemmon boasts of his 11 books in print including a cookbook hail to the chef and touching when he confesses he only writes the books to remind people that he still exists both actors have enormous charm work easily together and have enough parallels with reallife counterparts that we can amuse ourselves playing spotthechief executive i liked the moment for example when garner posing as his own celebrity impersonator meets a blonde who tells him she slept with the real guy garner is interested what was he uh like and i smiled as lemmon drank vodka from hotel minibars and then refilled the little bottles with water to keep from being charged

bob hoskins  who is sort of hooks official sidekick theres also a large group of orphans in neverland who are massed as if for group photographs and shunted here and there as if waiting for auditions for oliver the crucial failure in hook is its inability to reimagine the material to find something new fresh or urgent to do with the peter pan myth lacking that spielberg should simply have remade the original story straight for this generation the lack of creativity in the screenplay is dramatized in the sword fighting sequences between hook and peter which are endless and not particularly wellchoreographed they do not convince me that either williams or hoffman is much of a fencer has any hollywood director ever given thought to bringing in a hong kong expert like king hu to do secondunit work on the swordfights the cheapest asian martial arts movie has infinitely more excitement in its sword sequences than the repetitive lungeandshuffle that goes on here then comes the ending of the movie or the endings one after another farewells poignancy lessons to be learned speeches to be made lost marbles to be rediscovered tears to be shed the conclusion of hook would be embarrassingly excessive even for a movie in which something of substance had gone before here we get the uncanny suspicion that hook was written and directed according to the famous recipe of the country preacher who told the folks what he was going to tell them told them and then told them what he had told them

another problem is that the director jim fall  treats too many of the supporting actors as if he owes them favors its as if he promised them big scenes if they worked cheap we get fulllength renditions in piano bars spellings protracted audition and so on its as if the screenplay wants to keep moving but the camera cant drag itself away from whatever its watching would this same movie be entertaining with heterosexual characters in todays world it would hardly be thinkable the premise is so hackneyed that any characters in this plot would come across as dopes i guess the mark character would be the boy in the straight version which makes his sullen passivity all the stranger its like hes allowing himself to be dragged around by a partner much keener on the whole idea than he is

james ronald whitney  whose just melvin just evil is one of the most powerful documentaries i\ve seen about a man who abused and molested many members of whitney\s extended family and is finally confronted on screen what\s odd about games people play is that whitney seems to have set up the film and offered the 10000 prize in order to manipulate his actors and their victims into abusing themselves although acting is a noble profession there is little nobility in being an outofwork actor and the ambience at a lot of auditions resembles the desperation of a soup line games people play proves if nothing else that there are actors who will do almost anything to get in a movie the actors here joshua coleman sarah smith scott ryan dani marco david maynard elisha imani wilson are all effective in their scenes sometimes moving sometimes more convincing than they have a right to be but we cringe at how the movie uses them how do you rate a movie like this star ratings seem irrelevant it is either a brilliant example of an experiment in psychological manipulation four stars or a reprehensible exploitation of the ambitions and vulnerabilities of actors and others who did the director no harm zero stars because it evokes a strange and horrible fascination i suppose the stars must fall in the middle two but your reaction will swing all the way to one side or the other i felt creepy afterward

the story goes to some lengths to develop sympathy for the terrible tortures he was subjected to as a victim of racism who dared to love a white woman because the candyman is played by tony todd  who has more than a passing resemblance to oj simpson there are several scenes that have a curious double resonance i suppose that clive barker would be happy to explain to us how candyman farewell to the flesh is a statement against racism and maybe it is although it sure does go the long way around the message may be that because slaves were mistreated we pay the price today perhaps every time we look in the mirror and see our racism reflected back at us hey i didn\t take those englit symbology classes for nothing like many movies with morals at the end however it has its slasher and eats him too if the last 15 minutes of the movie are devoted to creating understanding for daniel robitaille the first 85 are devoted to exploiting fears of slasher attacks by tall black men with or without a hook for a hand and the flashback is overly elaborate did the mob vote against lynching robitaille deciding naw let\s just cut off his hand and smear him with honey so he can become an urban legend if not it seems they went to a lot more trouble than most mobs in those sad days

this takes up most of the movie although the point isnt made that population control is indeed a way of assuring the survival of the buffalo  no longer an endangered species no matter what the movie thinks but at the end of the movie we get a big onetwothree moral whizzero im still trying to sort out see after the kids open the gates and get the buffalo to leave the corral the buffalo don\t keep moving they just stop and then a group of hunters deprived of their chance to kill the animals later in the day turn up and boy are they mad so one of the kids leaps into a pickup and stampedes the buffalo by driving around them and blowing the horn the hunters immediately start to shoot at the truck aiming at the tires of course and saying watch out for the kid but alas the tyke is shot dead and after he falls out of the truck and everyone stands around silently shocked by the enormity of their actions the last shot is of the buffalo galloping to freedom now are we being told the boy died that the buffalo might live that our society murders all sensitive outcasts that hunters are irresponsible killers by default that guns have no place in our society that the boys like the buffalo are doomed species that the hunters should have aimed lower you see my problem i have another one too im getting a little sick\r\nof movies that end gratuitously with the old shooting the young to\r\ngive us the impression that a point has been made i left the theater\r\nin a nasty mood indeed i even caught myself wondering why kramer\r\ndidnt go whole hog and have the hunters murder the other five kids\r\ntoo then we could have really had a statement the movie begins with a dream sequence in which the parents trap the kids in the corral and kill them but never mind never mind

yes the movie leads up to the obligatory big fight but what is proven in the fight settles more about the characters and their relationships than it does about the plot this is a story about a girl growing up in a macho society and far from being threatened by its values discovering she has a nature probably more macho than the men around her since the movie written directed and produced by women is deeply aware of that theme its always about more than boxing karyn kusama was named best director at sundance for girlfight which also won the grand jury prize and she wisely realizes many of the changes in the story have to be embodied in the performances it would be fatal to spell out the themes in dialogue rodriguez a newcomer seems to have a natural affinity for the camera her diana hungers she cares she is easily wounded and quick to defend herself and all of those qualities are simply there every scene they don\t need to be underlined because rodriguez brings them along making this movie was good for me rodriguez said that day in cannes i learned discipline i\m a very irresponsible person with a short attention span i learned to dedicate myself to something was she talking about herself or her character the movie is stronger because that\s such a close call

for strong sexual content including graphic sexrelated dialogue language violence and scenes of alcohol abuse 99 minutes
as the movie dribbles to its inconclusive conclusion we are left with the notion that in this case date rape may be in the mind of the beholder men see things one way women another both sara and michael make persuasive arguments for their versions of events while the film which takes no sides carefully presents both versions of the sexual encounter this is like soft porn with a choice of point of view first we see saras bra taken off then we see it ripped off none of the characters and perhaps none of the filmmakers are enlightened about alcoholism one danger sign of alcoholism is when a guy uses a magic marker to write do me on your forehead during a party and you don\t notice as sara doesn\t and what about her friend whitney whose parttime job consists of passing out free shots for a brand promotion at a club and setting a good example by tossing them back herself i\m not saying the job brands whitney as an alcoholic everyone has to earn a living but that moderate drinkers somehow rarely find themselves employed as the freeshot girl it isn\t surprising that rick and jane the best friends don\t notice their friends are drunks the movie\s opening shot shows rick and jane in bed still dressed and the first line of dialogue is more realistic than most wakingup lines in the movies do you have any tylenol honey body shots means well and has some pointed dialogue about legal pitfalls but it\s clueless about its real subject my own theory of date rape is that if you think you had sex and you didn\t want to but you\re not sure why or how or if it happened it\s probably a good idea to call aa before you call the cops

 theyre attracted to one another and in a weirdly inventive scene they make love in the same room with the inactivated cassandra the intensity of their passion ignites the fire of life inside the android meanwhile more predictable things are happening in the plot the castaways turn out to be criminals kinski becomes obsessed with the need to complete his experiments and there are the usual scenes of people sneaking around corners and attacking each other this sort of movie is made for kinski of course who can play insane obsession as easily as other people can wait for the bus whats interesting though is that the movie doesnt simply end in a predictable violent shootout instead theres a wonderful confrontation that calls into question the whole business of who is and who isnt a human being and it also asks an even trickier question suppose youre not human but you contain a human intelligence can you then love and if love resides in the intelligence rather than in the heart is it an exclusively human attribute

clash of the titans  1981 but it has always been used sparingly because it takes such infinite pains to do correctly and because kids grew accustomed to the flat cartoon world of traditional animation what selick and burton have done with it however brings stopmotion to a new plateau the movements of their characters are so fluid compared with the slight jerkiness of older stopmotion that i wonder if computers have been used to smooth out some of the motion if not then their achievement is even more amazing all of the creatures especially the colorful insects that share james journey are brought to vivid life and the fact that we can see realistic textureslike the cloth in some of the costumesgives the illusion an eerie quality halfway between reality and invention as for the movie based on a familiar childrens book by roald dahl

the performances are subtle and wellcontrolled we often see roberts face illuminated in darkness she speaks little most of the time she does not understand as much of the story as we do malkovich is quiet but simmering with anger all he does to separate the two identities is to use facial hair as jekyll and not as hyde is hyde one of jekyll\s grownup wild oats asks bradshaw the footman they do look a bit alike when the two characters are speaking they are held in large closeups the movie is as visually intimate as a bergman film and avoids most of the cliches suggested by the material so what is it this fascination with the gothic for me it offers the fascination of secrets dreads and guilts modern horror is too easily explained indeed the real world has outrun horror and the headlines are now worse than anything stephen king

the answers to those questions were discovered by a man named apsley cherrygarrard in one of the most remarkable books ever written the worst journey in the world 1922 he was not writing about the journey of the penguins but about his own trek with two others through the bitter night to their mating grounds members of scotts 19101912 expedition to the south pole they set out in the autumn to follow the march of the penguins and walked through hell until he found them watched them returned with one of their eggs cherrygarrard retired to england where he lived until 1959 his friends felt the dreadful march and the later experience of finding the frozen bodies of scott and two others contributed to his depression for the rest of his life for jacquet and his crew the experience was more bearable they had transport warmth food and communication with the greater world still it could not have been pleasant sticking it out and making this documentary when others were filming a month spent eating at mcdonalds the narration is a little fanciful for my taste and some of the shots seem funny to us but not to the penguins when they fall over they do it with a remarkable lack of style and for all the walking they do theyre ungainly waddlers yet they are perfect in their way with sleek coats grace in the water and heroic determination its poignant to watch the chicks in their youth fed by their parents playing with their chums the sun climbing higher every day little suspecting what theyre in for

there is so much to enjoy about cold mountain that i can praise it for its parts even though it lacks a whole i admire the characters played by kidman and law even though each one is an island entire to himself i loved zellweger\s gumption and the way she treats a dress like a dishrag the battle scenes and the civil war landscapes shot in romania have beauty and majesty but winstone as the villain turns up so faithfully when required that he ought to be checking his clock like capt hook and although there is true poignancy in inman\s encounter with the desperate widow sara  natalie portman  it is poignancy that belongs in another movie nothing takes the suspense out of boy meets girl like your knowledge that boy has already met star by the end of the film you admire the artistry and the care you know that the actors worked hard and are grateful for their labors but you wonder who in gods name thought this was a promising scenario for a movie its not a story its an idea consider even the letters that ada and inman write to each other you can have a perfectly good love story based on correspondence but only i think if the letters arrive are read and are replied to there are times when we feel less like the audience than like the post office

this material could have been made into an interesting movie what was needed was a sense of pace less impersonal dialog and an end to artistic gameplaying in short it would have worked as a movie but it doesnt work as a photographed literary idea gary holds his closeups much too long especially in the case of miss seberg instead of providing dramatic impact and pacing they drag the movie to a halt gary doesnt like to move his camera much either his ideas of composing a scene are painfully elementary shots on the beach are invariably photographed by arranging his actors in a geometric pattern and having them march dreamily ahead the beach photography by the way was apparently meant to be surrealistic we get long vistas of barren sand with figures here and there in the landscape old peruvian masks and feathers and dying birds stuck in the sand and strange rocks on the horizon as if this were a salvador dali retrospective but none of it works the movie doesnt grow the characters drift through their vacuum rarely has so much pretension created so much waste but there is one and only one good cinematic moment the woman and the artist are alone in the cabin they embrace each other then they hear a strange sound taptap  taptap  two quick taps silence two quick taps again they look up it is the chauffeur come to murder them impatiently tapping his foot

the artist he is never named is played by lynch as a fierce sad young man who drives himself to a higher standard than he can achieve and is inspired by molls own defiant standards the movies most amusing scene comes when the artist proposes marriage moll insists on meeting his family and they drive down to a vast country estate a friendly man comes running up to greet their carriage is that your father asks moll youre not going to get off that easy the artist says as the man opens the gate and doffs his cap moll flanders is not a sunny reconstruction of an idealized past like sense and sensibility its closer in historical detail to  restoration  both movies show the population devastated by plagues as a story it\s an original densham took only the name the period and a few notions from defoe and has made up the rest moll in many ways resembles jenny the character she played in forrest gump both stand aside from their societies associate with outcasts and rebels and do not confuse sexuality with romanticism the films melodramatic ending sorts everything out in the approved style of the genre but the movie is really better than that a portrait of a woman who endures thinks and survives

that\s the case here after nemo\s bed takes flight and goes swooping out of the bedroom window and off into slumberland we enter a world that seems inspired in some part by  yellow submarine  the movie only loosely follows a story line careening from one adventure and character to another in a way that suggests dream logic little nemo is essentially the billiard ball necessary to get us from one pocket to another he spends a great deal of his time in his pajamas falling through infinity and screaming ohhhhhhhh he gathers some pals on his journey including a scientist a tout and four wideeyed goblins he also makes a friend of whitebearded old king morpheus who entrusts him with a royal scepter and a key and warns him to never ever use it to unlock the door behind which nightmares lurk the movie is persistently watchable on the visual level the animation stretches space and constantly redefines it as a dream might so that physical laws seem suspended and nemo hurtles from one surprise to another some of the dialogue is brighter than it might have been too

valerie harper and joe bologna there is absolutely no rational reason why this\r\nsubplot is in the movie maybe it made sense in the mechanics of the stage\r\nplay but it doesnt belong here and its all themore distracting because\r\nwhatdaya know bologna and harper are much better than caan and mason at\r\nconjuring up the romantic and comic juices of a love affair their scenes are\r\nmeaningless and unnecessary but at least theyre alive and just when they get\r\ntheir emotional rhythm flowing the movie cuts back to the nonstop marriage\r\ncounseling session that occupies the main plot

drama fantasy foreign mystery romance science fiction thriller rated r
for some sexuality nudity and a brief disturbing image 125 minutes
this is exciting beyond all measure to dominic who has researched the origins of language but it is also heartbreaking because he seems to have had his lost love restored to him only to be taken away by the implacable advance of age coppola found this story in a novella by the romanianborn mircea eliade for many years a scholar of religious history at the university of chicago it is possible to see how the movie might have been simplified and clarified into an entertainment along the lines of time after time but coppola seems to positively embrace the obscurity and impenetrability of the material there is such a thing as a complex film that rewards additional viewing and study but youth without youth i am afraid is no more than it seems a confusing slog through metaphysical murkiness that it is so handsomely photographed and mounted and acted with conviction only underlines the narrative confusion we know from interviews that the story means a great deal to coppola now at the same age as his protagonist but his job is to make it mean a great deal to us he is a great filmmaker and i am sure this film is only a deep shuddering breath before he makes another masterpiece

rated r for language
91 minutes the father we learn was killed in a fencing match many years ago the match was apparently over an affair of the heart and honor his sword now retired rests in a glass case in the fencing academy if we are veteran moviegoers the moment we learn this information little alarm bells start going off in the backs of our minds who killed villards father all those years ago could it be  might it be  is it conceivable that it could be suba now finally out of prison well of course it is the law of economy of characters in my moviegoers glossary teaches that there are no unnecessary characters in a movie and so if suba is there and the story of the longago killer has been told the rest is obvious and starting from there we can promise ourselves as surely as god made little green apples that sooner or later suba and villard will be facing each other with their swords in their hands the movie adds some supporting characters in order to show us things about fencing that we didn\t know and things about romance that we have already learned in a thousand other movies but by the sword is really about villard and suba and as eric roberts and f murray abraham play them they create characters much more interesting and dimensional than this thin screenplay really requires roberts makes villard a very precise man filled with himself smart  and too aware that he is smart he is so mannered we feel there must be a vulnerability there somewhere that he has long practiced to conceal abraham who can certainly be mannered when he wants to see  amadeus

106 minutes indeed the audience was perhaps the greatest problem with this very good film it was filled with matrons who found it necessary to shriek loudly and giggle hideously through threequarters of it and their husbands who delivered obligatory guffaws in counterpoint they had never seen anything funnier in their lives i guess than brando nervously brushing down his hair when he thinks a handsome young private is coming to see him but if you can set that aside then reflections is a better film than we had any right to expect it follows the mccullers story faithfully and without compromise the performances are superb besides brando there is miss taylor proving once again as she did in  virginia woolf  that she really can act believe it or not there is keith all understatement and quiet sympathy the photography is restrained shot in a process which drains almost all the color out of color film leaving only reds and pinks and an occasional hint of blue or green the result is a bleak landscape within which lonely and miserable people try to account for themselves

dried out bush is finally able to hold down jobs the movie is far from a chronological record organizing episodes to observe the development of his personality not his career even several spellbinding scenes about the runup to the iraq war are not so much critical of his decisions as about how cluelessly and yet with such vehemence he stuck with them through thick and thin at a toplevel meeting where he is finally informed that there are no wmds in iraq and apparently never were he is furious for not being informed of this earlier several people in the room tried to inform him but were silenced colin powell spends a lot of time softly urging caution and holding his tongue there is no indication that he will eventually resign the movies bush is exasperating to work with at his texas ranch he takes the inner circle on a march through the blazing sun misses a turn and assures them its only a halfmile back cheney after three heart attacks and rice wearing inappropriate shoes straggle along unhappily his parents are apparently even more disturbed by his decision to run for governor of texas than by his drinking cheney is lectured at a private lunch to remember who is president he quietly forgets many of the actors somewhat resemble the people they play the best is dreyfuss as cheney who is not so much a double as an embodiment the film\s portrait of george senior is sympathetic it shows him giving junior the cuff links that were the only real thing his own father sen prescott bush ever gave him the name and the oedipal complex were passed down the family tree

jill ireland this is their 11th film together and shes aloof and skittish as the sophisticated lady from the east but graham dorsey works on her he kids her and woos her lies to her and seduces her finally she pulls the covers off the fancy furniture her late husband brought from the east and decides theres been enough mourning in her house these scenes between bronson and ireland are what make the movie worth seeing bronson is courtly and calculating ireland is reserved and yet wants to be courted by this strange determined man and the two of them generate a real sexual presence if bronson cannot easily play a character totally unlike himself he can certainly project strongly within his own range his movies seldom give him the opportunity to play love scenes most of the actresses in them  miss ireland included  are backdrops for the action in from noon to three it\s as if a capacity for humor and gentleness has been released the movie\s problems are in the framework around the long central passages gilroy adds a layer of irony and legend that isn\t really necessary  we\d rather see more of the widow and the desperado after dorsey is captured and sent to prison the widow writes a bestselling book about her romantic afternoon the couple becomes the stuff of legend the subject of popular songs and broadway reviews and when dorsey comes back after several years to reclaim his love she\d    well she\d rather be a legend than his lover this unhappy development drives graham dorsey to despair hes surrounded on all sides by images of his great love affair  by souvenir picture albums guided tours of the widows house and cheap editions of her bestseller but he can neither recapture their love affair or even convince people he is graham dorsey and so he wanders from one tragic adventure to the next while the movie takes far too long to end the epilog seemed unnecessary to me the relationship between the bank robber and the sophisticated lady was enough for an intriguing film i wish gilroy had explored it further instead of allowing it to get lost in ironies that go on forever

for some mild language and crude humor 90 minutes
the problem with this story is that the movie pays too much attention to it as if we really cared most successful animation has a basic level where even small children can easily identify little nemo wanted to escape from the fish tank and return to his father in the ocean every kid understood that but how much will they care in shark tale that oscar wants to clear his debt with the loan sharks and become rich and famous will they follow the romantic struggle involving the zellweger and jolie characters the movie lacks a port of entry for young viewers  a character they can identify with all of the major characters are adults with adult problems like debt romance and running or swimming away from the mob in dealing with their concerns the characters do way too much talking maybe because the filmmakers were so thrilled to have great voiceover talent in earlier days the voiceover dubbers for cartoons were anonymous unless they were named mel blanc now they star in the movie so that the posters for shark tale list de niro smith zellweger and jolie in big type at the top as if we were really going to see them in the movie to be sure the fish look a little like their voice talents i wonder if salaries go up when the voices for animation agree to have their faces and mannerisms borrowed there are a lot of funny moments in shark tale freestanding gags clever lines neat twists but the movie never comes together into a convincing enterprise it\s so in love with its origins in gangster movies and has so much fun with the voices of its famous actors that it never really defines and sells the characters in a way the audience cares about there\s a point when you wish the filmmakers would drop the injokes and the subtle hollywood references and just get on with it the movie is likely to appeal to movie buffs more than to typical family audiences

98 minutes milla jovovich and brian krause  all we have to look forward to as pauline kael so presciently wrote is when are these two going to discover fornication the original blue lagoon at least had a certain purity of form this one complicates matters by having the island discovered by a passing ship which contains inevitably a young woman who makes eyes at the hero and a bearded sailor who bodes no good for the heroine that leads to the expected developments in which the hero and heroine decide they like each other best after all and the evil sailor has something terrible happen to him  like to take a random example being eaten by a shark the most curious aspect of the movie is the presence of natives on the other side of the island they apparently visit during every full moon beat their drums a lot and then paddle away in the morning there are ominous warnings about staying away from the other side of the island staying indoors during the full moon etc but nothing really comes of the presence of the natives its as if the filmmakers felt obligated to throw in a few ominously beating drums but didnt know where to take it from there

the movie also resurrects that ancient and dependable standby the choosing of the wires in countless other movies the bomb squad hesitates between red    or black red    or black\\ this is a bigbudget movie and presents us with five wires it\s an emergency and the president needs to decide which two he should connect see if you can guess the right two colors the choices are green yellow red white and blue the movie is wellserved by the quality of the performances close is convincing as the vice president and gary oldman has a couple of effective scenes as the terrorist murder you took 100000 lives to save a nickel on the price of a gallon of gas\\ and harrison ford is steady and commanding as the president even while we\re asking ourselves if a middleage chief executive would really be better at handtohand combat than his secret service agents some of the special effects scenes are effective but others are distracting in a key scene set near an open doorway on the plane none of the actors convinced me that they thought they were standing next to a 30000foot drop for one thing they never looked down which i think is more or less the first thing i would do a climactic explosion is less than authentic visually and scenes involving a russian political prisoner are confusing

rated r 114 minutes
that\s too bad i kept waiting for dolly parton to be sexy in this movie and she never was she was cheerful spunky energetic angry sad and loyal but she was never sexy not even in bed her feelings for reynolds seemed to be largely therapeutic and i believe there were even times when they discussed the nature of their relationship since just the mere word relationship is profoundly subversive to eroticism and sexuality we\re a little baffled to see the madam and the sheriff turned into the sort of couple that discusses itself in first person articles for cosmo this is carried so far that parton\s only reference to her bosom indeed the only moment in the movie when anyone deigns to even notice it is about her problems luggin\ these around it\s all so matteroffact it\s asexual parton and reynolds are pleasant enough in whorehouse and we expect that from two such likable actors dom de luise is wildly improbable and distractingly bizarre as the tv investigative reporter who wants to shut down the chicken ranch charles durning has a lot of fun with a sly songanddance routine lois nettleton

he had the most beautiful eyes she\d ever seen his eyes looked more to me like the kind of eyes where when you turned up looking like that the nuns sent you to see the school nurse but then perhaps i am being unfair perhaps i do not like thierry lhermitte perhaps i think he is the biggest drip i\ve seen in a love story in years he is the kind of romantic leading man who has the audience wondering when the real leading man is going to turn up and wipe this guy out of the picture but until september denies us that relief this is a dumb pointless boring romance from beginning to end some measure of its desperation comes during the french toast scene where the two lovers discuss the proper way to hold a fork this is a scene that cries out for a groucho marx to pop up at the first mention of a fork and cackle your place or mine a word about the plot karen allen plays an american tour guide who misses her group\s flight to warsaw that means she is stuck in paris for three weeks she goes to stay in a friend\s apartment another apartment on the same landing is occupied by lhermitte who is an international banker that means he makes phone calls about the halfbillion line of credit and then takes the rest of the day off to debate about french toast a movie like this depends entirely on chemistry and unfortunately there\s never a moment when i could believe that allen and lhermitte were really attracted to each other they discuss nothing of substance they share no real confidences the allen character occasionally makes a show of being a liberated woman and yet lhermitte\s big scenes are when he plays the worldly tutor for the wideeyed female explaining why different wines come in different kinds of bottles there is another fundamental problem with the film lhermitte is married and has kids he believes in honesty by which he means he tells allen about his wife but doesn\t tell his wife about allen because it would hurt her mistresses are hurtproof apparently the movie is so manipulative that at the end after the obligatory runningintoeachother\sarmsattheairport scene we are supposed to be happy that this man has abandoned his family to be with a woman he has nothing of interest to discuss with meanwhile do we see the glories of paris at least not really the movie doesn\t even manage to make the city into an interesting character and a visit to the country  a weekend on the riviera  is so strangely constructed that we have the impression all sorts of things happened in the screenplay that were cut from the film

are there spies in cut off there are certainly suspicious characters one of them is the german refugee dr lenz sands said to be jewish who has settled in as the only local doctor another oddly enough is the local priest father antoine curry who is charmingly drunk much of the time but also spends ominous evenings in the cemetery using an iron cross as an antenna for his shortwave radio whether the priest is a spy and whether the doctor is all he says he is will not be discussed here there are two possible romances in the film one between the widow picou and the german the other between the ensign and young florida there is also much malicious gossip all adding up to a scene in the doctors front yard when a lynch crowd turns up and seems remarkably easy to convince of first one story and then another objectively the scoundrel\s wife has problems and there will not be a person in the audience convinced of what happens in the last scene but i just fired off a note to a campus film critic who was being urged to write more objectively and asked him what is a review if not subjective so let me confess my subjectivity

still one wonders why newsreel shots of hitler and reminders of the nazi past are necessary in a film that has almost no time at all to explain who the palestinians were or why they made such a desperate raid the raid had nothing to do with the nazi past and the current germans seemed like comicopera buffoons from a groucho marx comedy if the purpose of a documentary is to inform it could be argued that audiences already know a great deal about hitler but are not likely to learn much from a couple of perfunctory shots of palestinian refugee camps one day in september grips the attention and is exciting and involving i recommend it on that basisand also because of the new information it contains i was disturbed however by macdonald\s pumpedup style and by a tasteless conclusion in which images of action bloodshed and corpses are cut together into a montage and backed with rock music what was he thinking of footnote when one day in september won the academy award in 2000 its producer arthur cohn

 as a martial arts fighter jackie chan is amazing as usual in the action sequences and zhang ziyi has handtohand combat with chris tucker in a scene of great energy there are the usual chanstyle stunts including one where the heroes dangle above city streets on a flexible bamboo pole and a couple of those moments over in a flash where chan combines grace ability and timing in one he slips through a tellers cage and in another he seems to walk up a scaffolding given chans soso command of english its ingenious to construct a sequence that silences him with a grenade taped inside his mouth but tucker\s scenes finally wear us down how can a movie allow him to be so obnoxious and make no acknowledgment that his behavior is aberrant in a nightclub run by hong kong gangsters he jumps on a table and shouts ok all the triads and ugly women on one side and all the fine women on the other he is the quintessential ugly american and that\s not funny

136 minutes no doubt this movie is aimed at the black market the ads and the spoken narration dwell at length on the evil of slavery about how africans were brought to america and mistreated and tortured and how terrible that all was the trouble is the narration is only a cover for the movie\s real purpose which is sadistic the movie gloats over scenes of human degradation and this time there isn\t even the excuse of documentary every scene in this movie was specifically staged unfortunately jacopetti and prosperi have been able to find people willing to undergo the humiliation inflicted on them in farewell uncle tom most of the blacks in the film are apparently africans forced by poverty and need to do these things for a few days\ pitiful wages this is cruel exploitation if it is tragic that the barbarism of slavery existed in this country is it not also tragic  and enraging  that for a few dollars the producers of this film were able to reproduce and reenact that barbarism make no mistake this movie itself humiliates its actors in the way the slaves were humiliated 200 years ago a man without a hand is photographed shoving mash into his mouth from a trough very young girls are mocked in auction scenes pregnant women  women who are really pregnant  are corralled into a scene about the breeding of slaves the fact that this film could find a booking in a legitimate motionpicture theater is depressing

68 minutes well that\s what the movie says and a lot more as your correspondent i report it and i will receive emails from readers who will protest this review and tell me a movie critic has no business getting involved in politics but here is the movie and here is what it says that there are no probush documentaries this season is curious but true i have been asking for two months to see a film named michael moore hates america but the filmmakers have not provided it the most difficult aspect of hijacking catastrophe is to accept the argument that the neocons have wanted to invade iraq for years as part of a plan to conquer and occupy the middle east and that is why 911 inspired their curious decision to deflect american power from bin laden to saddam an uninvolved bystander why does this make me think of larry punching curly who retaliates by punching moe fear of terrorists provided their cover and norman soloman of the institute for public accuracy says roosevelt\s statement the only thing we have to fear is fear itself has been rewritten by the neocons and their orange alerts into the only thing we have to fear is not enough fear it is an ancient debating technique to identify your opponents ideas with similar statements by evildoers nevertheless this movie opens with a quote that seems eerie in its relevance

102 minutes   hilary and jackie  who directed red riding 1983 is a specialist in clearly delineated ambiguity at odds with the moral anarchy of his segment i gather they were not hired to reproduce their strengths but to find the right approach for this material i have given only the sketchiest of plot outlines here the trilogy isnt so much about what happens objectively which can sometimes be hard to determine but about the world in which it takes place a miasma of greed and evil i have no idea whether the real yorkshire police were led by monsters such as these someone must have thought so channel 4 aired these segments as they stand

102 minutes william h macy who has been with mamet since his earliest theater days is an ideal choice for this kind of work he always seems like the ordinary guy who is hanging on for retirement he\s got that open willing face and the flat helpful voice with sometimes the little complaint in it and in spartan he starts out with what looks like a walkon role we\re thinking david found a part for his old pal and ends up walking away with it val kilmer a versatile actor who can be good at almost anything who else has played batman and john holmes here plays lean and hard sam jackson style his character is enormously resourceful with his craft but becomes extremely puzzled about what he can do safely and who he can trust derek luke a rising star with a quiet earnestness that is just right here disappears for a long stretch and then finds out something remarkable and tia texada in the rosario dawson role succeeds against all odds in actually playing a woman soldier instead of a sexy actress playing a woman soldier i like the safe rooms with the charts on the walls and i like the casual way that spycraft is explained by being used and the way mamet keeps pulling the curtain aside to reveal a new stage with a new story i suppose the last scene in the film will remind some of our friend the deus ex machina

the events described take about 30 minutes there is not a single funny thing that happens once the men get to vegas diaz has some funny early stuff about the wedding nor is the aftermath funny as the men freak out with guilt and fear robert makes threats to hold them in line but more deaths follow and the last act of the film spins out a grisly unfunny screwball plot by the time of the wedding when potentially comic material crawls back in over the dead bodies its way too late to laugh the movies tone is too meanspirited and sour very bad things isn\t bad on the technical and acting level and slater makes a convincing engine to drive the evil berg shows that he can direct a good movie even if he hasn\t if he\d dumped the irony and looked this material straight on it might have been a better experience his screenplay has effective lines as when robert coldly reasons what we have here was not a good thing but it was under the circumstances the smart play but the film wants it both ways at a jewish funeral the sad song of the cantor is subtly mocked by upbeat jazz segueing into the next scene mourners fall onto the coffin in a scene that is embarrassing when a widow  jeanne tripplehorn

it is a blessing that blame it on fidel doesn\t pull back to answer such questions but focuses resolutely on the world as seen through 9yearold eyes kids don\t care if millions are starving in south america nearly as much as they care that threecourse family meals have been replaced by weirdlooking casseroles they don\t care if there really is a god nearly as much as they like the nun who teaches divinity class they\re not thrilled that their parents are away in spain or chile fighting evil they want them at home every night and no matter what anna is told she knows these things are true and will not be swayed the film contains a surprising amount of understated humor it is not a grim portrayal of a harsh upbringing but an affectionate portrait of parents who will be able to change the world before they will be able to change their daughter anna and her parents continue to love one another above all and so this is not an angry film but a wry observant one it could have been worse for anna consider sidney lumet\s  running on empty  1988 about the family of radical underground members in hiding anna\s parents haven\t bombed anyone although they do circulate lot of petitions

these implausibilities are ignored by the movie it knows that with characters we like we want good things to happen to them we know who we\re cheering for in the dance competition i saw musical chairs with a registered nurse who cared for me at the rehabilitation institute of chicago and she loved it it was lifeaffirming she said if anyone knew at first hand how inaccurate it was she knew but she didn\t mind neither to a degree did i that\s what fantasies are for to help us imagine that things are better than they are there are however two areas where the movie is guilty of misinforming audiences armandos mother believes that if her son marries mia they cannot have children nobody corrects her many disabled women can and do become mothers the other area is wheelchair dancing it is a beautiful and demanding performance art even assuming youve had a full course of rehabilitation its unlikely youll be winning many trophies after three months of night classes taught by instructors with no experience in wheelchairs ive seen wheelchair dancing it can be transcendent it is not easy

in  citizen kane  which welles made in 1941 there occurs my favorite passage of movie dialogue old mr bernstein is talking about the peculiarities of time a fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn\t think he\d remember he says you take me one day back in 1896 i was crossing over to jersey on the ferry and as we pulled out there was another ferry pulling in and on it there was a girl waiting to get off a white dress she had on she was carrying a white parasol i only saw her for one second she didn\t see me at all but i\ll bet a month hasn\t gone by since that i haven\t thought of that girl late in deja vu a character tells a similar story about a woman he once met a week hasn\t gone by since i last saw her that i haven\t thought of her she was the love of my life yes and can you dear reader think of such a moment too perfect love is almost always unrealized it has to be what makes those memories perfect is that they produce no history the woman with the white parasol remains always frozen in an old man\s memory she never grows old is never out of temper never loses interest in him never dies she exists forever as a promise like the green light at the end of gatsby\s pier only rarely does the universe wheel around to bring two hearts once again into communion that\s what deja vu is about and that explains the two most curious characters in it they are the old couple  anna massey

there is also the matter of the way chicago is depicted in the movie it wasn\t of course filmed on location here not only that  it wasn\t filmed on location anywhere its sets look suspiciously like the same hollywood backlot street sets used in the st valentine\s day massacre during the chase scenes the cars keep chasing each other around the same corners because there are only about four corners in the whole city and native chicagoans will be amazed to see the lushly wooded california hills rising at the end of wabash ave ben gazzara  as capone talks in a shrill shout that makes us want to turn the treble down and hes surrounded by a supporting cast that looks almost as embarrassed as he does the acting isnt really the point though because the movie has been so chopped into neatly dated segments that no development of character and personality is really possible the characters get their labels and wear them and die with them and thats it the sole funny scene suggests however that a legitimately funny movie could be made about al capone by somebody like mel brooks

james mangold  has the richness and complexity of a novel but the best movies are more like novellas all of these characters are seen in such detail that any three of them would make a story a dozen leave us trying to remember who is who and why the stallone character offers the closest thing the movie has to a center but his sheriff like some of the other characters seems to have suffered in the editing early in the film for example he gets drunk and smashes up a squad car but then his alcoholism is dropped and his sadness because he should have married liz is established without being developed there are even greater problems with the de niro character who has three big scenes without any little scenes to tell us how he got from one point to another he challenges stallone to work with him in exposing the crooked cops then seems to reject him and then reverses himself with a line of dialogue that stands out like a sore thumb and what about the keitel character keitel has some of the best moments in the movie especially a barroom speech about separating the men from the boys but after helping the rookie disappear as a suicide why does he flaunt him alive at a drunken cop partyespecially considering what he wants to do next james mangold wrote and directed  heavy

rape squad 1975 horror
90 minutes the whole movies like that and were not surprised to learn that it was directed by a man but its principal author was a woman the dialog adopts a militantly feminist position but the actresses recite it wearing miniskirts and seethrough blouses on those occasions indeed when they bother to dress at all in a typical scene one of the squad members distributes antirape leaflets in a parking lot which requires her to lean over the hoods of cars and display an expanse of thigh to truck drivers eating their lunch nearby when they make rude remarks she counterattacks fiercely getting so angry that it\s necessary for her to lean forward and display some cleavage we don\t know whether to look or listen the story involves a rapist with the nickname jingle bells who\s been terrorizing young women with his attacks his disguise includes a goal tender\s mask so he can\t be identified in lineups five of his victims dissatisfied with the police work on the case decide to form their own rape crisis program and take karate lessons the karate instructor is a compact young woman who could no doubt demolish bruce lee singlehanded she has the girls practice hitting a dummy in the groin with nightsticks once trained the rape squad turns into a feminist vigilante unit they\re everywhere like batman and robin a black pimp for example is mistreating one of his girls in a parking lot a squad member calls in the entire karate class piles into a vw bus and races to the rescue the pimp is kicked unconscious while the girls bang up his thunderbird with sledge hammers mission accomplished they leave the pimp groggily wakes up only to be knocked unconscious by the hooker who has instantaneously had her consciousness raised wouldn\t you know though that when the chips are down our heroines make all the dumb mistakes women do in movies where they\re mere sex objects instead of liberated sex objects jingle bells lures them into an abandoned zoo at night the girls walk along single file one decides to return to the car bells picks her off another one loses the heel from her shoe he gets her too the other three turn around and there are frantic cries of where\s gloria where do you think haven\t you seen any westerns lately with the indians picking off the stragglers there\s also a certain amount of entrapment which the movie apparently approves of rape squad members wear their sexiest dresses to a nightclub where the manager is an alleged rapist one of the girls allows herself to be picked up and taken to the guy\s apartment to see flicks of his last ski holiday in switzerland uh huh astoundingly no such film is there to be shown why the beast wants to make out the victim screams the rape squad breaks through the door the karate instructor sends the depraved monster flying through the air the girls wreck his apartment and then they pour indelible blue dye labeled sulphuric acid  their little joke on his genitals that way i guess the next time he tries to get fresh with a sister she\ll know him by his true colors

it is an argument to sway a medici cities were built on the same premise the pyramids were constructed because some glib egyptian toback sat next to a pharaoh on a long chariot ride one of the most powerful desires in this life is to be remembered after we have left it most people are not remembered very long but we all hope to be  if only because we won the lottery or went over niagara in an inner tube in the big bang we hear from people who have survived the holocaust and others who know they are dying we hear from the young and the old from black and white from artists and from those who envy artists what they say often is very interesting but the real point of the film is simply that they are saying it their eyes turn inward and there is a certain wonderment in their voice and we realize that they are being photographed in the moment of turning away from petty matters and thinking about what it means to be alive my disappointment with toback is that he did not cast his net a little wider most of the people he talks to are the sorts of people a movie director might meet in the course of an ordinary lifetime a violinist and a basketball star an author and an artist a mother and a daughter i wish the approach had been extended to encompass more of the family of man the very very old for example the very poor people from other lands and cultures the big bang may be a sketch when a mural is called for but it is a challenging sketch the kind of movie that you want to see with a friend and then sit down afterward for a good long talk

105 minutes  given this premise the movie immediately tries to discover how many dumb things it can do with it how many nobrainer plot twists it can discover and how best to make beart and cates into inanimate objects the entire plot revolves around such stock figures as an angry fatherinlaw a jealous girlfriend and madcap buddies it does not even spare us the obligatory press conference scene which is mangled here almost as badly as it was in hello again the angel finally speaks in a human tongue all right but in the last scene of the play just when she was ready to maybe say something interesting the movie was over this movie ought to be shot it wastes not only the idea of the angel but also the human presence of cates a bright and quick actress who is required to play a simpering bimbo how come the filmmakers didnt have the wit to allow cates to join her boyfriend in getting to know the angel instead of making her into an idiotic shrew imagine the girltalk she could have had with somebody her own age from heaven i fear this film will have a sequel the last shot has knight and beart submerged in a passionate kiss and beart has traded in her wings for a nurse\s uniform her first words are that she has been granted a leave of absence which is kind of a theological breakthrough since angels have no bodies and exist outside of time making it easy for them to handle the absence part but almost impossible for them to leave  or arrive for that matter no doubt the sequel will be titled second date with an angel stranger things have happened in the week that gave us teen wolf too

92 minutes as the straight man sheen has the most thankless role in the movie and there are scenes where he seems to realize that tucker sorvino and warner have all the best lines he stands there while tucker goes on wild verbal riffs and has the thankless task of appearing to take him seriously some critics dislike sheens performance but i think its more or less whats called for he provides the solid backdrop for the anarchy and probably feels like margaret dumont to tuckers groucho marx the movie marks the directing debut of brett ratner

stellan skarsgard is quite effective as bestyreren a man who mouths platitudes about how the school will help restore its boys to full and productive lives he has an unreasonable optimism given the reality of the school experience which places emphasis on forced manual labor and punishment skarsgard evokes a studied detachment he seems distracted from the reality at hand by his vague optimism c19 eventually becomes the catalyst for an inmate uprising dramatically staged by director marius holst with a balance between the latent wildness of the boys and their sometimes small stature in one touchy scene they allow the governor and his wife to safely leave a dangerous situation because they seem to have some grudging gratitude for his faith in them there is a harrowing scene as two of the boys try to escape across thin ice the film plays well and is involving but in one form or another this is a story often told 
ruby 1978 cast
ruth hurd as ruby
directed by dick bartlett
so far i could be describing mary hartman but bartlett directs this material in the oddest way presenting the bizarre with an absolutely straight face so that the movie constantly challenges us to make up our minds about it is rubys whirlwind romance with earl being made fun of yes but its a little wonderful too especially in her fantasy of running through a field with earl her orange pants suit streaming behind her in the wind and what about vivians battle with the chastity belt especially in the scene where her desperate boyfriend protects her stomach with doublestrength aluminum foil and then goes after the padlock with a blowtorch ruby was shot independently on a low budget in what looks like the cape cod area and bartlett exploits his budget limitations the nightclub where ruby first meets earl for example is obviously someones basement recreation room its furnished with card tables and folding chairs the tablecloths are garish paper and each table has a solitary tapered candle that looks completely out of place earl comes across as a thirdrate merv griffin and a firstrate merv griffin is no big deal in my book ruby falls for him and he likes her too and they eventually sneak out for a night on the town  in rubys school bus clifford meanwhile stirs his fudge and then sells it wheeling his chair down a roadside obviously lacking any possible fudge customers vivian goes to pick up a chicken for her parents brings it home hanging from the handle bars of her bike accidentally lets it fall into the road and watches in horror as a car runs over it so much for supper her parents have bitter arguments over her but they occasionally exhibit some good sense as when her father angrily throws her discarded chastity belt onto the roof and then reflects to his wife ill get the ladder wed better get that damn thing down off of there well i said the movie was odd odd maybe its crazy but what it does is very sneaky it takes the ordinary rhythms of normal lives and considers them from a few degrees off from reality its a whole movie done from the point of view of the famous second city skit about the man who drowned himself in a giantsized can of pork and beans but then theres one more level too the one on which in some weird way we really do like ruby and hope her dreams come true

dean semler  finds color and texture in the shadows that evoke that hour between midnight and dawn that fitzgerald called the dark night of the soul oddly enough as santa annas troops march up to within 100 yards of the alamo there seem to be hardly any watchmen to see them and when they attack it is a surprise the battle scenes when they come are brutal and unforgiving we reflect that the first mexicans up the scaling ladders must have known they would certainly die and yet they climbed them heedlessly this intimate handtohand conflict is balanced by awesome long shots combining the largest sets ever build by modern hollywood with some special effects shots that are generally convincing although the battle for the alamo has taken its place as a sacred chapter in american history the movie deals with the fact that it all came down to one thing mexico owned texas and ambitious americans and texans or texians wanted it many of the fighters had been promised 760 acres of land as a bonus for enlisting for bowie crockett and travis the challenge was to rehabilitate reputations that had gone astray  to redeem themselves for sam houston who never sent reinforcements it was an opportunity to apply wellington\s strategy in leading napoleon on a chase until napoleon\s army was splintered and weakened houston was too wise to commit his army to the alamo that took foolishness bravery and a certain poetry of the soul

judy irving 82 minutes
it is a record of reckless mishandling of nuclear wastes criminal disregard for the rights of american citizens being poisoned in their own homes and bizarre nuclear experiments that resemble nothing so much as a bunch of mad scientists playing with their toys dark circle is a big ambitious rambling documentary it could use more focus it tries to cover everything  from the victims of hiroshima and nagasaki to the first postwar bomb tests to the fallout scares of the 1950s right up to the present plutonium nightmare outside denver it is a tribute to the power of the material and to the relentless digging of the filmmakers that the movie is completely riveting of all this film\s material the best i think deals with the people living downwind from rocky flats dark circle documents the situation there where plutonium is turning up all over the place cattle are dying chickens are not reproducing and children are getting cancer at a statistically alarming rate the movie doesn\t just recite these figures it brings them home by interviewing families who live beneath the poisonous winds of rocky flats one young mother vows to sell her house and move she wont let her children continue to live there later in the films most heartbreaking scene we revisit that mother she has sold her house she and her children are moving she averts her face she does not want to talk about the fact that the buyers she found  are another family with small children

rated pg13 for brief strong language and smoking
96 minutes lee sternthal  may sound like a movie about literature but it isnt it ingeniously avoids quoting more than a few words from the hemingwayesque novel and although clayton hammond reads more from his novel theres no suggestion that were dealing with the son of hemingway or even the cousin of the movie does however slyly leave open the possibility that his novel is the story of his own life what does work are the performances especially jeremy irons as the old man he\s not as angry about jansen\s plagiarism as you might assume and indeed the real hemingway considered his lost manuscripts juvenile work in life hadley did save a few carbons one of which was the short story up in michigan which is a work of genius we can only wonder what was lost watching the movie i enjoyed the settings the periods and the acting i cant go so far as to say i cared about the story particularly after it became clear that its structure was too clever by half theres also an appearance by jk simmons as jansens father not a very necessary character but its funny how often you see simmons playing someone in a movie and wish the whole movie was about him

146 minutes the message of the novel if i read it correctly is that gatsby despite his dealings with gamblers and bootleggers is a romantic naive and heroic product of the midwest  and that his idealism is doomed in any confrontation with the reckless wealth of the buchanans this doesn\t come through in the movie when nick at his last meeting with gatsby tells him how much he admires him you\re worth the whole crowd of them we frankly don\t know why unless we\ve read the book oh were told to be sure the sound track contains narration by nick that is based pretty closely on his narration in the novel but we dont feel weve been distanced by the movies overproduction even the actors seem somewhat cowed by the occasion an exception is bruce dern who just goes ahead and gives us a convincing tom buchanan we dont have to be told the ways in which tom is indifferent to human feeling because we can sense them but we cant penetrate the mystery of gatsby nor to be honest can we quite understand whats so special about daisy buchanan not as shes played by mia farrow  all squeaks and narcissism and empty sophistication in the novel gatsby never understands that he is too good for daisy in the movie we never understand why he thought she was good enough for him and thats whats missing

91 minutes  is enlivened by the cookie kings own sense of humor but the movie meanders it doesnt set itself a clear goal and there are times when sheer panic sets in there are for example not one but two fake surprise birthday parties in the film always a sign of desperation and there is a visit to santa which is not handled nearly as well as it usually is in movies about precocious kids what makes the movie watchable is christina vidals performance shes a bright nononsense type who plants her feet and delivers her lines and looks fox square in the eye too bad that fox seems adrift most of the time it almost seems as if neither he nor the director made a clear decision about what his character would be like at the beginning and end of the film and how to get from one point to another fox seems so unfocused that even though he has spent years practicing he cant even puff on a cigarette in a way to convince us hes a real smoker i left the movie wondering why the screenplay was even considered filmable there\s nothing compelling about it nothing original life with mikey is a genial aimless movie of low ambition and that\s a shame because christina vidal at least deserved better

rocky  it is not difficult to imagine them at the top their hands in triumph above their heads well was this such a bad thing the renoirs and picassos can now be seen by anyone visiting the museum instead of by a limited number of art students the film could do a better job of allowing the public access issue to be defended but what it does is tell a cautionary tale it is perfectly clear exactly what barnes specified in his will it was drawn up by the best legal minds it is clear that what happened to his collection was against his wishes it is clear that the city fathers acted in obviation of those wishes and were upheld in a court of appeals what is finally clear it doesnt matter a damn what your will says if you have 25 billion and politicians and the establishment want it

 many of the interviews were conducted by michael borofsky and jeff rosen was a key contributor but scorsese provides the master vision and his factual footage unfolds with the narrative power of fiction what it comes down to i think is that robert zimmerman from hibbing minn who mentions his father only because he bought the house where bobby found a guitar and mentions no other member of his family at all who felt he was from nowhere became the focus for a time of fundamental change in music and politics his songs led that change but they transcended it his audience was uneasy with transcendence they kept trying to draw him back down into categories he sang and sang and finally still a very young man found himself a hero who was booed isn\t it something how they still buy up all the tickets he asks about a soldout audience that hated his new music what i feel for dylan now and did not feel before is empathy his music stands and it will survive because it embodied our feelings we wanted him to embody them too he had his own feelings he did not want to embody ours we found it hard to forgive him for that he had the choice of caving in or dropping out the blues band music however good it really was functioned also to announce the end of his days as a standardbearer then after his motorcycle crash in 1966 he went away into a personal space where he remains

98 minutes the blue lagoon  this time he seems to be going for something more than soft porn in the lagoon he wants to tell us something about these characters he wants gasp to have insights about them but only up to a point his problem then is that his insights keep interrupting the sex and the sex keeps undermining the insights the result is a movie that doesnt really work as semierotic romance and never quite gets itself together as a character study its as if frankie and annette were in therapy

nishi is therefore i suppose psychotic a dangerous madman to read his behavior any other way as protecting his wife say would be childish sane people do not behave like this and his wife who hardly says six words in the movie and who seems unaffected by his brutal behavior shares the family madness but that isn\t really the point this is not a clinical study but a distillation of attitudes in kitano\s bipolar universe you are happy when the world leaves you alone and when it doesn\t you strike back against this swing of yin and yang there is a steadying character horibe the man in the wheelchair he paints naive yet colorful and disturbing pictures of people with the faces of flowers at one point his wheelchair is at the edge of the sea and we anticipate suicide as the tide washes in but he is a man who has found some accommodation with life and will endure nishi on the other hand has adopted such an inflexible and uncompromised attitude toward the world that it will we feel sooner or later destroy him the film is an odd viewing experience it lacks all of the narrative cushions and handholding that we have come to expect it doesnt explain because an explanation after all is simply something arbitrary the story has invented

95 minutes he cares more about validating his characters than having them do much of anything the movie carefully reproduces the fashions of the period sort of latehippie crossed with military chic and jumble sale and shows its characters in a series of romances designed to emphasize his beliefs that blacks and whites and straights and gays all share a great many more feelings and experiences than separatism allows them to admit the movie ends with climactic love scenes one each for a straight and gay couple and again i was reminded of sammy and rosie with its threeway splitscreen arguing i guess that sex is an answer to the world\s problems  or a heartfelt reproach anyway the soundtrack of young soul rebels is filled with the kind of music its characters are promoting and is fun to listen to even when it doesn\t seem to have much connection with the characters there is also the sense of a large community mirrored in the many supporting roles including political radicals hashishheads and not a few radio rebels who will find themselves in the music establishment before long

lets begin with the most annoying example of\rhis meddling missing contains scenes that take place before the young man\rdisappears we see his domestic happiness with his wife and friends we see him\rreading from the little prince and making plans for the future the fact that\rthis material is in the movie suggests at least that the story is being told\rby an omniscient author one who can also tell us if he wishes to what\rhappened to the victim but he does not costagavras shows us all sorts of\rominous warnings of approaching trouble including a lot of loose talk by\ramerican military men who are not supposed to be in the country but are and\rall but claim credit for a coup he shows us a tragic aftermath of martial\rlaw guns in the streets vigilante justice and the chilling sight of row\rafter row of dead young men summarily executed by the new junta but he does\rnot show us what happened to make the films hero disappear or rather he\rshows us several versions visual fantasies in which the young husband is\rarrested at home by a lot of soldiers or a few and is taken away in this way\ror that these versions are pegged to the unreliable eyewitness accounts of the\rpeople who live across the street they dramatize an uncertain human fate in a\rtime of upheaval but they also distract fatally from the flow of the film by the time missing begins its crucial last\rhalfhour a strange thing has happened we care about this dead american and\rhis wife and father almost despite the movie the performances of spacek and\rlemmon carry us along through the movies undisciplined stylistic displays but\rat the end of the film there isnt the instant discharge of anger we felt at\rthe end of costagavrass great  z  1969 because the narrative juggernaut of\rthat film has been traded in for what is basically just a fancy meditation on\rthe nature of reality something happened to the missing young man his story\ris based on real events somebody was guilty and somebody was lying and he\rwas indeed killed but missing loses its way on the road to those\rconclusions and at the end lemmon and spacek seem almost to mourn alone while\rthe crew is busy looking for its next shot

 knows exactly what hes doing like hitchcock he gives the audience precisely enough information to be frustrated it is obvious to us what the characters should be doing but there are excellent reasons why it isnt obvious to them if you can contrive that in a screenplay you have already surpassed the level of the usual modern thriller another strength of the film is in its attention to characters the killer is seen as a mental dead zone a man without a conscience to whom good and evil are equally meaningless the pimp begins as a merchant of sex goes looking for youngmin for simple mercenary reasons and gradually expands his concerns in response to the presence of the call girls young daughter the daughter follows the rule that instructs us that all children in movies when told to stay put quickly wander away into danger well can we blame the director how interesting would it be if she obediently stayed put what i responded to was the streetlevel reality there are no supermen and no sensational stunts when the actors run we see that they are running these shots extend in time and are not constructed after baffling editing the spatial realities of the chases are respected we begin to learn our way around the neighborhood the cops are not stock characters but just your average officers no one in the chaser seems to be on autopilot

if the movie is a moral labyrinth it is paradoxically straightforward and powerful in the moment each individual story has an authenticity and impact of its own consider the pathos brought to aviva by the actress sharon wilkins  who is a plussize adult black woman playing a little girl and who creates perhaps the most convincing little girl of them all or jennifer jason leigh  three times as old as aviva but barely seeming her age these individual segments are so effective that at the end of each one we know how we feel and why its just that the next segment invalidates our conclusions

in 1951 jacy was content to be the center of male attention to be a tease and a flirt now that three decades have passed she sees things a little differently and one of the unexpected developments in this film is the way she makes friends with karla duane\s wife and they get to be so thick that actual rumors get started duane meanwhile has his own problems in the romantic area not to mention trying to deal with his son\s and one of the most common attitudes in this movie is lethargy in the face of overwhelming developments the town motto could be what you gonna do bogdanovich brings some of the story threads together in a long sequence built around the anarene centennial celebration and there is a parade in which jacy gets to wave from a float decorated with the tactless legend homecoming queens through the ages there are also some moments of heartfelt emotion confession and tragedy and the oil crisis and other international events occasionally hover on the horizon but in general the town seems to be as preoccupied as ever with its own personalities and memories as if it were sitting for its portrait is texasville as good as the last picture show no because the previous picture was complete and this one seems to lack a genuine reason for existence jacy does indeed return to town but once there she seems to fall easily into the general aimlessness and the citizens of anarene seem so accepting of human nature that they have given up having any dreams or expectations there has to be more to life than screwing around well doesn\t there and yet in a subtle way texasville is making the same point as the previous film that the last picture show has closed and that the dreams of the old west the dreams in movies like  red river

94 minutes the drama mostly involves the characters locking the door against dogs the locals and one another running into the woods in search of escape or help trying to start the truck which like all vehicles in horror films runs only when the plot requires it to and having sex lots of sex the nature of the disease is inexplicable it seems to involve enormous quantities of blood appearing on the surface of the skin without visible wounds and then spreading in wholesale amounts to every nearby surface if some of this material had been harnessed and channeled into a disciplined screenplay with a goal in mind the movie might have worked but the director and coauthor eli roth  is too clever for his own good and impatiently switches among genres tones and intentions there are truly horrible scenes guy finds corpse in reservoir falls onto it overthetop horrible scenes dogs have eaten skin off good girls face but she is still alive and just plain inexplicable scenes dennis the little boy at the general store bites people by the end weve lost all interest the movie adds up to a few good ideas and a lot of bad ones wandering around in search of an organizing principle

112 minutes as his father and len cariou as a family friend there are lots of smalltown details in the movie conversations that exist for no other reason than to establish the everyday reality against which the haunted events of the night take place the movie does a good job of telling a complicated story which accounts for the various ghosts and other midnight apparitions and yet it is not shy when it comes to special effects and cliffhanging endings its kind of tricky reviewing a movie like this almost nothing i can say will accurately reflect the tone of the film i can write about ghosts and killers and strange old ladies and i could be describing a much different film but lady in white like most good films depends more on style and tone than it does on story and after awhile its the whole insidious atmosphere of the film that begins to envelop us like the best ghost stories of m r james and oliver onions who were the best in their classic field lady in white is finally not really about being frightened by ghosts but about feeling pity for them

100 minutes just another love story works in nice little touches i liked jonas\ partner in photographing crime scenes who deals with the violence and gore by laughing about it there\s a scene where a horrifying situation is described and the guy shakes he\s chuckling so hard why is this shown well if you photograph murder scenes you deal with it the best you can the whole movie flavors its plot with quirky observations and asides it\s interesting that two of the best thrillers of the last several months  tell no one  and just another love story have come from europe both movies gain because they star actors unfamiliar to us they gain because there\s room in them for close observation of the characters they gain most of all because they don\t slow down the plot for unnecessary specialeffects scenes  fights chases things like that unless such scenes are necessary or very well done essentially they just put the plot on hold while the filmmakers flex their muscles here the plotting has all the muscle that\s required 
a man a woman and a bank 1979 action comedy romance
rated pg 100 minutes
there are some good sequences especially one with sutherland and mazursky on the roof of an elevator car being searched by security guards but the movie just doesnt commit itself to being about a bank robbery it also wants to be about a personal relationship between sutherland and adams and since their relationship isnt clearly implicated in the robbery the movie bounces from one story to another and loses its way that leads me back to my opening question did noel black really want to make this movie pretty poison still one of hollywood\s best sleepers was absolutely fascinating on the personal level as it explored the tensions between weld and perkins it was less surefooted in dealing with their adventures the same happens here im guessing but i wonder if black doesnt really want to deal with offbeat human relationships but his films are financed by people who want to throw in crimes and complications for insurance at the box office

in phoenix\s first scene it is obvious he\s in trouble the rest of the movie only confirms it making the thing called love a painful experience for anyone who remembers him in good health he looks ill  thin sallow listless his eyes are directed mostly at the ground he cannot meet the camera or the eyes of the other actors it is sometimes difficult to understand his dialogue even worse there is no energy in the dialogue no conviction that he cares about what he is saying some small part of this performance may possibly have been inspired by phoenixs desire to emulate james dean or the young brando in their slouchy mumbly acting styles and maybe thats how bogdanovich and his associates reassured themselves as they saw this performance taking shape after all phoenix came to the project as one of the most promising actors of his generation and perhaps somehow an inner magic would transmit itself to the film it does not the world was shocked when phoenix overdosed but the people working on this film should not have been it is notoriously difficult to get addicts to stop their behavior before they have found their personal bottoms and so perhaps no one could have saved phoenix who was not lucky enough to find a higher bottom than death but this performance in this movie should have been seen by someone as a cry for help bogdanovich does what he can samantha mathis is plucky and spirited in the lead role and the milieu is entertaining everyone in the movie even cops and taxi drivers seem to be aspiring songwriters but at the center of the film is an actor whose mind and heart are far far away and he is like a black hole consuming light and energy hes running on empty sometimes there are even scenes where you can sense the other actors scrutinizing phoenix in a certain way or urging him with their tones of voice to an energy level he cannot match it is all very sad

whether she chooses and whether he acts you will have to discover for yourself what you will find is a film with an uncanny feeling for the rhythms of daily life acted by scott and davis with attention to those small inflections of speech that can turn words into weapons there is also a lot of physical acting the youngest child in particular has a great need to be held and touched and hauled around in her parents arms and then there are the five days of the flu as first one and then another family member develops a fever and starts throwing up scott is wonderful here in the way he shows his character caring for the family while coming apart inside i suppose the slater character is essential to rudolphs idea of the movie which is based on the novel the age of grief by jane smiley  to introduce slater\s imaginary presence is a risk and a reach and i suppose deserves credit especially since leary plays the character about as well as he can probably be played but i wanted less in a way i wanted to lose the whole fantasy overlay and say with the movie\s strength which is to show the everyday life of a family in crisis there are real feelings here which go deep and are truly felt and the whole slater apparatus is only a distraction the secret lives of dentists tries hard to be a good film but if it had relaxed a little it might have been great

is pierce brosnan better or worse as bond than connery lazenby moore and dalton this is one of those questions like why doesnt tomorrow ever die that can be debated but never answered basically you have connery and then you have all of the rest i enjoyed brosnan in the role although this time i noticed fewer bondian moments in which the trademarks of the series are relished yes we have the usual double entendres and product placements i find product placement distracting in most movies but sort of anticipate them as part of the bond formula theres a high gloss and some nice payoffs but not quite as much humor as usual bond seems to be straying from his tongueincheek origins into the realm of conventional technothrillers still tomorrow never dies gets the job done sometimes excitingly often with style the villain slightly more contemporary and plausible than usual brings some subtlerthanusual satire into the film and i liked the chemistry between bond and wai lin all the more convincing because the plot doesnt force it the look of the film is authoritative the scenes involving warships and airplanes seem sleek and plausible theres gorgeous photography as a junk sails in a sea filled with peaks and astonishing action choreography in the rooftop motorcycle chase on the basis of this installment the longestrunning movies series seems fit for the 21st century

100 minutes this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship mr ozu is apparently the first person in some years to regard madame michels bristly exterior and realize she is warm and good beneath the surface feeling rejected by society she has retreated to a small room in her apartment with her cat and her beloved books and lives a life of the imagination theres little that happens in the building that paloma doesnt observe and often she records it on a video camera this will presumably produce a document to explain her complaints about her family and in particular her feelings about the goldfish and why she has departed this life but now a strange thing happens she begins to see madame michel transformed by the quiet courtesy of mr ozu and she learns by inference that she must have more respect for her own warm insides and not be so fond of her prickly exterior the hedgehog isn\t one of those movies where the heroine is transformed by a beauty makeover the actress josiane balasko is not a beautiful woman although of course she would be attractive if she permitted her face to advertise a sunny personality we get a hint of this in a single smile so small so astonishing i won\t go into the details of the polite relationship between the concierge and her new gentleman nor will i mention a crucial event later in the film all of that has to be experienced in context

he isnt one of those directors who delights in confusion and frustration when he shows us something we cannot understand and then pulls back to explain it he takes the same delight in his revelation as a magician would  or a silent comedian like buster keaton  thats why the movie is so consistently entertaining instead of just sitting there while the plot unfolds  one two three so that we can see that each event does indeed follow the last  he keeps us watching and guessing as the jigsaw of his story and relationships finally becomes a complete picture having never met atom egoyan i am willing to guess that he is one of those people who loves puzzles and paradoxes who sees the world in a wry skewed way who is vastly amused that what we take for granted might be a complete deception he would probably be gifted at card tricks but he would want a deck with more than 52 cards

the climax of the movie is fascinating in the way it uses a really corrupt cop to create a situation in which the two friends are faced with the consequences of their actions by the end of the film sweeney and sheen both possess all of the facts and in a way they both understand all of the facts they think there must be a way they can work this thing out but maybe there isn\t like the film noir thrillers of the 1940s no man\s land is about ordinary people with flawed characters who fall to temptation and pay for it the performances are very good by sheen who played the narrator in  platoon  and especially by sweeney who at first seems lost in his role until we realize that\s the character he\s playing the director is peter werner 
play it again sam 1972 comedy drama romance
rated pg 87 minutes
comedy maybe because play it again sam is based on woody\s broadway play and with a play it\s a little hard to work in material like a howard cosell playbyplay of an assassination in south america still as comedies go this is a very funny one woody allen is one of those rare comedians who understands that humor can be based on pathos as well as sadism while the highpressure comics overwhelm us with aggressive humor woody is off in the bathroom somewhere being attacked by a hairdryer the notion of using a bogart character is surprisingly successful the bogie imitation by jerry lacy is good if not great and the movie begins and ends with variations on that great casablanca ending that and the movie\s rather conventional broadway plot structure give it more coherence than the previous woody allen films  take the money and run  and bananas maybe the movie has too much coherence and the plot is too predictable that\s a weakness of films based on wellmade broadway plays still that\s hardly a serious complaint about something as funny as play it again sam

diane venora  whose character trait singular is that she lights a cigarette every time she is not already smoking one i kept waiting for her to be killed so that a last puff of smoke could drift from her dying lips as her fingers relaxed their grip on her lighter there was never a moment in the jackal\\ where i had the slightest confidence in the expertise of the characters the jackal strikes me as the kind of overachiever who assigned to kill a mosquito would purchase contraband insecticides from iraq and bring them into the united states by hot air balloon distilling his drinking water from clouds and shooting birds for food

 doyle despises dutch as a workingclass stiff  on the basis of his shoes his haircut and various other apparently subhuman attributes  and dutch defends the working class in one of several spirited philosophical conversations the two of them have while driving north to chicago these conversations actually do read as if they had been written by buckley the precocious little sob is smart and articulate he is also vicious a karate expert who slams dutch with a golf club the first time they meet this and their other confrontations are all however very safely on track the parabola of this movie will inevitably lead to a final scene in which that angry little face breaks into a smile of warmth after dutch finally drums love and respect into the tousled little head of the adventures along the road the less said the better partly because there are some surprises and partly because these characters like martin and candy in pta ignore all of the dictates of common sense in order to stay on the road if you\re in indiana somewhere and your car has been destroyed and your wallet stolen and you\re traveling with a young kid and there\s money in the family what would you do 1 hitch a ride in freezing weather on the outside of a truck transporting concrete culverts or 2 call collect to have someone come and get you or send you some money the hughes screenplay goes to incredible lengths to keep its characters from doing the next obvious thing the performances got on my nerves after awhile o\neill who plays the popular workingclass hero on tv\s married    with children is a likable actor with a strong screen presence but here he not only has to behave in defiance of common sense he also has to hit all of the marks of the formula hope trust betrayal disappointment anger determination renewal breakthrough etc its like a little acting class as for young ethan randall he seems smart and capable but his character is allowed to be too obnoxious for too long until we finally just get sick of the little worm

 have not made a revenge movie and the film isnt constructed to inspire cheers when douglas pulls the trigger maybe it will play that way for some audiences but more thoughtful viewers are likely to pick up on douglass anomie  his soulsickness that has turned to madness his bafflement at becoming obsolete and irrelevant because the character is white and many of his targets are not the movie could be read as racist i prefer to think of it as a reflection of the real feelings of a lot of people who lacking the insight to see how political and economic philosophies have affected them fall back on easy scapegoating if you dont have a job and the korean shop owner does it is easy to see him as the villain it takes a little more imagination to realize that you lost your job because of the greedy and unsound financial games of the gogo junk bond years what is fascinating about the douglas character as written and played is the core of sadness in his soul yes by the time we meet him he has gone over the edge but there is no exhilaration in his rampage no release he seems weary and confused and in his actions he unconsciously follows scripts that he may have learned from the movies or on the news where other frustrated misfits vent their rage on innocent bystanders nor does schumacher build to some kind of easy audiencepleasing climax the way the movie ends is the way it must in real life  not the way it would in death wish vii and the values and style of the duvall character reflect not a triumphant cop but simply a guy who still believes in trying to roll with the punches and make the best of things falling down does a good job of representing a real feeling in our society today it would be a shame if it is seen only on a superficial level

101 minutes  as the teenager does a wonderful job of conveying the confusion and hope of a girl who discovers her real mother and at the same time discovers the sad truth about her the movie was directed by gillian armstrong  who also directed davis in the movie that won her an oscar nomination my brilliant career this film doesnt have the same impact perhaps because the story itself is of tired and almost defeated characters but it has the same quality especially in the performances and the ending of the film which could have been a mechanical melodrama has a very particular impact

 and the fly but brooks\s intelligence and taste seem to switch off when he makes his own films and he aims for broad dumb comedy jokes about names with dirty double meanings are his big specialty maybe the reason spaceballs isn\t better is that he was deliberately aiming low going for the nobrainer satire what does he really think about star wars or anything else for that matter brooks got his start as a writer for sid caesar  and sometimes he still seems to be writing for early 1950s television he is smarter than his films and sometimes that translates into a feeling that he underestimates his audiences he is potentially a great comedy director in 1987 he shouldn\t be making star wars satires may the schwartz help him to realize his potential already

121 minutes james franco  is a rich kid embarrassed by his dads wealth who is peters best and only friend and norman is affectionate toward peter even while their alteregos are deadly enemies that works and theres an effective scene where osborn has a conversation with his invisible dark side the origin story is well told and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books its in the action scenes that things fall apart consider the scene where spiderman is given a cruel choice between saving mary jane or a cable car full of school kids he tries to save both so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose the visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea in other cgi scenes spidey swoops from great heights to street level and soars back up among the skyscrapers again with such dizzying speed that it seems less like a stunt than like a fastforward version of a stunt

and francesca marciano based on ammaniti\s novel the plot is essentially a thriller but the film surrounds those elements with details of everyday life with ambiguities and mysteries seen through a child\s eyes and a puzzle about the nature of the agreement between pino and sergio certainly the family is poor and at one crucial moment his mother asks michele to promise when he grows up to get away from here the ransom money represents a hope for a new beginning salvatores is not in a hurry to get to the climax he allows summer days to follow one upon another as micheles secret grows in the boys mind there are details that enrich the portrait as when he longs for a toy blue truck that belongs to a friend and strikes a bargain to get it we are acutely conscious of filippo chained in the hole but for michele there are other things to think about and the urgency of the situation only gradually grows upon him the film reminds us that in childhood days and weeks seemed to last forever summer was not a season but a lifetime parents represented a law that stood above our own best thinking because they had demonstrated time and again that they knew best that we were only children the comingofage experience which i\m not scared incorporates involves that moment or season when we realize that we can see outside the box of childhood that it is time to trust our own decisions

as examples is there anything that can be usefully said about the images of blacks in this movie it is the sort of material that makes you wonder why blacks object to the resurrection of amos and andy since sucka is incomparably more offensive than anything the kingfish ever did but here all of the ethnic jokes are in a movie made by blacks and so that takes off the curse i guess the problem is the satire in this movie isnt aimed at racist cliches and stereotypes  it emulates them in other words if you always thought superfly was an objectionable stereotype this movie encourages you to laugh at the flyguy character but there is no new satirical edge to shed any fresh light on the subject

99 minutes i will omit certain additional details involving allen and rose separately and i suppose i shouldnt describe the melodrama of the closing scenes except to say theyre an anthology of clichs and theres a car ride in which way too much communication takes place at long last in a much too facile fashion so the screenplay is a soap operatic mess involving distractions loose ends and sheer carelessness yet sarandon creates a wrenching performance of a woman torn apart by grief and brosnan is convincing as a man holding it together as long as he can as for mulligan and simmons what can i say there is nothing they do wrong but this film written and directed by shana feste leaves both characters deprived of explanation development and revelation and you cant get me to believe that after you have sex one time and get pregnant and your lover is killed and you have absolutely nobody

because allen is a great verbal wit and because hes effortlessly ingratiating i had a good time at the movie even while not really buying it i enjoyed tea leonis sunny disposition although she spends too much time being the peacemaker between the two men in her life and not enough time playing a character who is funny in herself george hamilton  as a tanned studio flunky suggests a familiar hollywood type the guy who is drawing a big salary for being on the set without anybody being quite sure what hes there for he carries a golf club to give himself an identitythe guy who carries the golf club and mark rydell smiles and smiles and smiles as an agent who reasons that anything he has 10 percent of must be an unqualified good thing as waxmans seeing eyes barney cheng adds a nice element not only is waxman blind but he is being given an inexact description of the world through the translators english which is always slightly offtrack i liked the movie without loving it it\s not great woody allen like sweet and lowdown or  bullets over broadway

alain delon  he also was a solitary man of few emotions but that film surrounded his loneliness with characters and embedded him in a great maze of plot the robber has not so much a plot as a series of events the relationship with the woman is left openended the attempts of the parole officer to care about him result in violence he wants to rob banks and run what brought him to this point remains an enigma the movie therefore offers meager pleasures of character where it excels is in staging and cinematography the running sequences in races on city streets and through forests are very wellhandled the film inserts him in real races his expertise in stealing cars and dealing with their owners is direct and efficient curiously we care so little about him that it doesnt much matter to us if he escapes or not we watch with the same interest that we bring to a race with no runners we care about here is a wellmade movie with insufficient interest in its hero 
le secret 1975 drama thriller
now about that ending and the gloomy profundities i mentioned earlier the movie ends with the bad screenwriters crutch a narrator who comes in and explains what happened next and from that were supposed to deduce that trintignant did indeed possess a big secret and that the government had to murder him and that the french have their watergates too and that paranoia is just a reasonable reaction to the state these days maybe so maybe not but if the point\s so important why does enrico play with us sometimes unfairly for the whole movie why can\t we be in on the problem as we were in  three days of the condor  or z instead of sitting through two hours of evasions on our way to the surprise ending

one spectacular battle scene involves the attack of saladins forces on christiancontrolled jerusalem and its one of those spectacular set pieces with giant balls of flame that hurtle through the air and land close but not too close to the key characters there is a certain scale thats inevitable in films of this sort and scott does it better than anybody even so i enjoyed the dialogue and plot more than the action ive seen one or two vast desert cities too many nor do thousands of charging horses look brand new to me and the handtohand combat looks uncannily like all other handtohand combat godfrey gives balian a lesson in swordsmanship chop from above but apparently the important thing to remember is that if youre an anonymous enemy you die and if youre a hero you live unless a glorious death is required youd think people would be killed almost by accident in the middle of a thousand swordswinging madmen but every encounter is broken down into a confrontation between a victor and a vanquished its well done but its been done what\s more interesting is ridley scott\s visual style assisted by john mathieson\s cinematography and the production design of arthur max a vast set of ancient jerusalem was constructed to provide realistic foregrounds and locations which were then enhanced by cgi backgrounds additional horses and troops and so on there is also exhilarating footage of young balian making his way to jerusalem using the 12thcentury equivalent of gps go to where they speak italian and then keep going

gandhi seems typecast for the role of kumare tall thin bending forward to listen better he speaks warmly and encouragingly and makes deep eye contact he smiles easily he never pushes too far he seems as real as any guru and more real than some his teaching of yoga seems within the ability of his followers to accomplish he narrates the documentary in an ordinary american voice introduces us to followers hes grown close to and begins to believe he may have started something that was out of his control he tells his followers the time has come for him to leave them now they are on their own he returns to new jersey cuts his hair shaves his beard and begins to practice a speech in the mirror i am not who you think i am whether he ever says this and how the movie ends i will leave for you to discover it seems to me that kumare reflects a truth that is often expressed in three words act as if if you can act as if something is true in a sense that makes it true it doesn\t matter if a teacher\s spiritual teachings have any basis it doesn\t matter if the supernatural even exists gandhi believes it does not his followers benefit by acting as if when i first heard this film described i assumed it would be a satirical snarky comedy like sacha baron cohen\s borat not so gandhi seems to be essentially a good man and he learns things of value to himself in his experiment in a sense the deception he practices on his followers is contemptible but in another sense they\re all in it together the film\s implication seems to be it doesn\t matter if a religion\s teachings are true what matters is if you think they are

148 minutes is this because all the big numbers were assigned to midler i think the problem is deeper than that the filmmakers never knew who eddie or dixie really were thats why we dont know which side to take in the tortured subplot involving dixies son danny who eddie loves as if he were his own eddie has a wife and three daughters of his own but does not love them at all for reasons not cited other than the wifes alcoholism established with one big backstage glass of booze in a role limited to two dozen words eddie and dixie grow famous for breaking up most notably during a hit tv show in 1950 after eddie fires his writer because he may be a communist sympathizer and dixie walks out the two do not speak until the 1960s when eddie seduces dixie into a vietnam tour with the promise she can see her son now a military officer on the battlefield the outcome of that reunion is not happy but nothing on the screen indicates why they then again stop speaking for another 25 years maybe what it all comes down to is that i didn\t like eddie and dixie separately or together and when bette midler wasn\t singing there was little in the movie to entertain me a showbiz biopic is one thing and midler made a good one the rose but a movie with the ambition to deal with serious and depressing subject matter needs more dramatic substance instead of perfunctory arguments punctuated by unconvincing reunions remembered by a bitter old woman

 who like many actors is better with people than with the camera there isnt dazzling directorial virtuosity here but direct and economical filmmaking that focuses directly on the characters the screenplay by michael mb galvin and peter speakman is based on a bestselling young adult novel by kl going which tells a story with deep appeal lillard deserves more time behind the camera and i think well be pleased to watch wysockis development as an actor in the world of acting many are thin but few are talented

apart from the difference in their ages they really are wellsuited to one another at least as long as they can dream and are not distracted by pragmatic reality varda is one of the most individual and intriguing of contemporary french directors in part because each of her films seems to satisfy a different need her masterful  vagabond  was so different in tone from kungfu master that its hard to believe they come from the same director `vagabond told the story of an unhappy young woman who left her boring job for a carefree life on the road and gradually sank one small step at a time down the scale of social acceptability until she became a vagrant that film suggested that we may all be closer to the gutter than we think if we lose our discipline and our support systems

108 minutes  when he\s quizzed about his friendship with the pathetic hitler his answers are simple he came back from the war to nothing he doesn\t have any friends yes hitler is antisemitic and makes no secret of it but in germany in those days antisemitism was like the weather you couldn\t do anything about it and you had to go out in it rothman takes hitler\s rantings with weariness and sadness and at one point tells liselore i told him his insane f ideas are holding him back as an artist there is never even for a moment a glimmer of evidence to suggest that hitler could have been a successful artist his drawings look like the kind of cartoon caricatures that bored boys create in their notebooks in the back row of geometry class playing with their protractors and dreaming of supermen hitler instinctively fails to see the point of abstract art at one point he suggests that rothman frame his diarrhea we are reminded that in power both the nazis and the soviets banned and burned abstract art curious that art which claimed to represent nothing nevertheless represented so much to them perhaps art is a threat to totalitarianism when it does not have a clear censurable subject and is left to the musings of the citizen as the title suggests max centers more on rothman than on hitler max is a kind dreamy hopeful man who we presume saw his share of the horrors of that particularly nasty war and trusts that art is taking him in the right direction he is also smooth and sophisticated a master of onearmed cigarette technique who moves seamlessly between his bourgeois home and the cafes and dives of bohemian munich he is worldly in a way that hitler is not and their differences are suggested when he says in exasperation to the fierce failed artist listendo you want to meet some girls hitler\s other patron is an army propagandist named mayr  ulrich thomsen

 1996 an inyourface film about a car full of minority graffiti artists on a crosscountry odyssey here their hearts are in the right place but the film tries to say too many things for its running time i believe ches outrage at his sons personality i do not believe his son would challenge him by suggesting che found out something about gay sex in prison at that moment i felt a screenplay talking not a character the films treatment of ches alcoholism is perfunctory its used for plot points not character revelation i believe an africanamerican woman and a mexicanamerican man could certainly come together in the way the movie shows but i was puzzled that the film scarcely seems to get deeper into that than the casting and jes lover is not simply too good to be true hes too good to be interesting this is jordan max rosenak who is cleancut wholesome supportive and of course with loving parents i would have liked him to be a little more complex i dont even know how jes and jordan met hes simply there because the story requires him some crucial scenes take place in a hospital these scenes i think overplay ches feelings i dont require acceptance and reconciliation and la mission is forthright in avoiding easy answers but does the screenplay shortchange che by painting him more broadly at the films end than he seemed at the beginning if experience does anything it leaves us wiser

the traffic jam shows us a civilization that has gotten clogged up in its own artifacts finally abandoning their car the motorists set out crosscountry on the most peculiar odyssey since gullivers they meet historical figures they walk through scenes from other movies they are casually raped they see bodies set afire this is a radical bitter view of society and godard is at pains to dismiss any optimistic liberal solutions it used to be thought in the days of john dewey that universal education would be the salvation of mankind so godard provides a scene in which culture is brought to the masses a grand piano is set up in a barnyard and the pianist begins to play in a startling shot godard places his camera in the center of the barnyard and moves it through two complete 360degree revolutions we see the entire barnyard pianist listeners passersby the camera crew twice in sequence why why not there are some other strange things two long political speeches are delivered and we cannot understand why a they are so stupid if meant to be taken seriously or b why they are so serious if meant as a joke this is the case i would say with about 95 per cent of the rhetoric inspired by currently fashionable radicalism godard also gives us an allegorical ending in which various animals and members of the cast are killed and eaten and other things but by now we are totally lost in this new godard universe everything makes sense but nothing holds together are people talking to each other or to us whats going on its as bad as life

 wisely follows ishiguro in burying any meanings well within a human story the film is about kathy tommy and ruth and their world and not some sort of parable like 1984 essentially it asks how do you live with the knowledge that you are not considered a human being but simply a consumer resource many hourly workers at big box stores must sometimes ponder this question never let me go would have made a serious error in ramping up contrived melodrama toward some sort of sciencefiction showdown this is a movie about empathy about how ruth realizes kathy and tommy were naturally in love with each other as adolescents and how she selfishly upset that process about how now when it may be too late she wants to make amends about the old rumor at hailsham that if two donors should fall deeply in love they might qualify for some sort of reprieve  shortterm to be sure but if their masters can believe they can love they would have to believe they are human two of the requirements for a being with a soul in thomist philosophy are free will and the ability to love donors qualify for both this is such a meditative delicate film i heard some snuffling about me in the darkness these poor people are innocent they have the same hopes everyone has it is so touching that they gladly give their organs to humankind greater love hath no man than he who gives me his kidney especially his second one

rated pg 120 minutes
claude berri  does not tell this story as a melodrama all of the motives are laid out well in advance and it is perfectly clear what is going to happen the point of the film is not to create suspense but to capture the relentlessness of human greed the feeling that the land is so important the human spirit can be sacrificed to it to create this feeling berri stands well back with his camera there are not a lot of highly charged closeups to turn the story into a series of phony high points instead so many of the shots are surrounded by the landscape and the sky and there is one enormously dramatic set piece when the sky fills up with rain clouds and the thunder roars and the rain seems about to come and then as depardieu and his family run outside to feel it against their faces the rain falls elsewhere and depardieu shakes his fist at the heavens and asks god why he has been forsaken but god has not doublecrossed him his neighbors have and the enormity of their crime is underlined by the deliberate pace of this film which is the first installment of a twopart epic the second part will open around christmas we realize here that human greed is patient and can wait years for its reward and meantime daily life goes on in provence and neighbors pass the time of day and regret that it is impossible to make a loan of a mule

in the original version there was an endless pointless sequence of bud driving through western states and collecting bug splats on his windshield the 812 minutes gallo has taken out of that sequence were as exciting as watching paint after it has already dried now he arrives sooner in california and there is the nowfamous scene in a motel room involving daisy  chloe sevigny  yes it is explicit and no it is not gratuitous but to reveal how it works on a level more complex than the physical would be to undermine the way the scene pays off the scene and its dialogue and a flashback to the daisy character at a party work together to illuminate complex things about bud\s sexuality his guilt and his feelings about women even at cannes even after unendurably superfluous footage that scene worked and i wrote it must be said that [sevigny] brings a truth and vulnerability to her scene that exists on a level far above the movie it is in gallo takes the materials of pornography and repurposes them into a scene about control and need fantasy and perhaps even madness that scene is many things but erotic is not one of them a female friend of mine observed that bud clay like many men has a way of asking a woman questions just when she is least prepared to answer them

cliff curtis  apparently knows something about this bodhi tree but never explains the rules when jack finally apparently redeems himself it seems to be by instinct or good luck i say apparently because as heaven\s my witness i\m not completely sure if jack is alive dead or reincarnated at the end of the movie you could build a case for all three the running gag is that jack has to communicate without speaking or talk himself to death at one point this struggle is conducted by using several dozen talking dolls and action figures which are conveniently scattered around the literary agency jack also does desperate pantomimes and gets so frustrated he seems ready to explode im thinking what id try is writing notes but no when he tries that the leaves drop off anyway i learn from wikipedia that a thousand words was originally filmed in 2008 it was scheduled at one point to open in 2011 but was rescheduled until after the oscars to take advantage of murphy being named named to host the ceremony that didn\t work out either

 and then the film is over it is not the sort of film a lot of moviegoers find satisfying certainly not the skinflick fans but in its highly mannered way it goes against the flashy camera tricks and fashionable gimmicks of 1960s directors and probes for the subterranean psychological passions of a henry james novel and in that way les biches becomes a moody quiet highly personal expression

we meet james and theresa shannon and gerard and calvin and sara and julie james and theresa have it all figured out they even have their own business cards they cruise the back roads of the nation pulling up to bars in their motor home meeting new friends inside and inviting them out to the winnebago for a swap meet shannon and gerard are more complicated she seems deeply neurotic about the lifestyle he wants to swing without her they have a child who they try to insulate from mommy and daddy\s everchanging new friends and there\s even a scene where they chat about their lifestyle with her mother getting points for openness when they should be penalized for inflicting their secrets upon the poor woman now as for calvin he uses the rhetoric of the lifestyle primarily we suspect as a way to justify sleeping with both sara and julie neither one of whom is particularly enthusiastic about his hobby he wants it all but isnt a good sport when sara and julie slip off without the middleman although mateswappers would have you believe that they are open and willing participants in their lifestyle the evidence on screen suggests that men are a good deal more keen about the practice than women perhaps because there is an intrinsic imbalance in the pleasures to be had from quickie anonymous sex when i first saw the movie i had fundamental questions about how much of it could be trusted on ebert  roeper i said there\s a scene where james and theresa are in a club and they meet another couple and they ask the other couple \do you want to swing\ and the other couple says \sure\ and they say \oh we have our motor home right outside\ and so they go outside the two couples and the camera  and i\m wondering let\s say i wanted to be a swinger and i\ve just met two people who are going to take me into their motor home am i going to wonder about the fact that this happens to be videotaped while it\s happening when i saw scenes like that i thought this has all been rehearsed it\s a setup after the show played i got an email from joe gantz who assured me that all of the scenes in the movie do indeed reflect reality one key to their footage is that they always have two cameras running all the time to supply cutaways and reaction shots another is that by definition they only show couples who agreed to be photographed if a hypothetical couple got to the motor home and balked at the cameras they wouldn\t be in the movie

for actionviolence and some sensuality 104 minutes
among many silly scenes the silliest has to be the ferris wheel sequence which isn\t even as thrilling as the one in  the notebook  wouldn\t you just know that after the wheel stalls the operator would recklessly strip the gears and the little boy riding alone would be in a chair where the guard rail falls off and then the seat comes loose and then the wheel tries to shake him loose and no doubt would try to electrocute him if it could the score by klaus badelt is particularly annoying it faithfully mirrors every action with what occasionally sounds like a karoke rhythm section the director whose name is pitof was probably issued with two names at birth and would be wise to use the other one on his next project

collaborator barry gifford  avoids a rich vein of true cambodian stories and recycles the kind of generic financial crimes that hollywood perfected in the 1940s still sometimes the very texture of the film and the information that surrounds the characters on the screen make it worth seeing i didnt believe in james caans cons but i believed him and at times like that its helpful to stop keeping score and live in the moment between the caan and dillon characters there are atmosphere desperation and romance and at the end something approaching true pathos enough

state of siege the result of their snooping is an indictment of american interference in south american internal affairs costagavras and solinas have changed the location and the names of the characters all they claim is that the events in the film actually took place in a south american country but the paperback edition of the screenplay includes documentation indicating that mitrone was actually advising the uruguayan police and armed forces on counterinsurgency tactics including torture the movie is structured more or less in the style of z with quick cutting from one location to another the guerrillas crossexamine their captive the police scour the city and the government edges toward collapse flashbacks show the american involvement in local politics and the corrupt nature of the cabinet state of siege exists in an interesting moral middle ground the aid official played with a resigned cynicism by yves montand  is clearly made to seem wrong but what is the correct course for the guerrillas to take if they murder him one observes the world will speak of his seven children if they dont they will appear impotent and will lose credibility they dont want to kill him but as he himself observes in a way they will have to neither the local nor the american governments will agree to the guerrilla demands and montand says he wouldnt either if the decision were his

hearts and minds 1974 documentary war
rated r 110 minutes
the problem is that the film is at such pains to make its points that it doesn\t trust us to find our own connections we see a tearful graveside scene in north vietnam for example with a widow trying to throw herself onto her husband\s coffin and then we get westmoreland soberly explaining that orientals don\t place a high value on life in this and his other comments about what he calls the oriental philosophy westmoreland comes over as not only racist and stupid but incredibly lacking in awareness of how his remarks will sound this man ran a war for years in a country he didn\t begin to understand and yet placing these two pieces of film together  and the editing in hearts and minds consistently makes similar matches  finally only undermines the film\s effectiveness it\s too heavyhanded we\re bludgeoned by the point of view we don\t like the feeling of manipulation we get yet there are scenes here of incredible power even for a nation which watched this war on television every evening there are the shots already famous of a viet cong suspect being summarily executed and of a little girl running screaming down a road her skin burned by napalm there are interviews with us pilots who callously talk about how they enjoy the thrills the sense of danger on bombing missions and then there is a pilot who in a moment of truth says he never thought at the time about what his bombs were doing down below but now he\s haunted by the notion of his own daughters being napalmed

mary mccormack  frets that his mind is always on his work why must all men involved in great enterprises have wives who are obsessed with whether they come home for dinner on time is it forbidden that the wife also become fascinated with the case and get involved no matter the heart of the movie is in the spacey performance and in knowing that less is more he plays prot absolutely matteroffactly kpax\\ avoids an ending that invites tears and supplies one that encourages speculation is prot really from another planet what happens to him at the end is not quite the answer it seems to be and consider his range of vision his versatile blood pressure his tolerance for thorazine and the fact that he describes the intricate orbit of his planet to astronomers who have just discovered it against this we must balance the investigative road trip that powell makes to new mexico which offers a persuasive answer and then snatches it away perhaps prot simply borrowed a human form a final answer is unprovable on the basis of what were told and i like it that way i admired how the movie tantalized us with possibilities and allowed the doctor and patient to talk sensibly if strangely about the difference between the delusional and that which is simply very unlikely whether prot is right or wrong about where he comes from is not as important as what he does with his conviction

as the caravan plows across hundreds of miles of texas on its way to sugarland and the foster home a kind of camaraderie grows between the trooper michael sacks and the husband  william atherton  the trooper has only been on the force nine months but hes levelheaded enough to know that his kidnappers dont want to kill anyone there are poignant scenes in which the husband learns how to speak in police radio jargon and when the trooper explains the techniques behind highspeed chases if the movie finally doesnt succeed thats because spielberg has paid too much attention to all those police cars and all the crashes they get into and not enough to the personalities of his characters we get to know these three people just enough to want to know them better were burdened instead with countless telephoto shots of squad cars but the movie has its moments and when the fugitives parade down main street and are presented with gifts by their newly made fans we admit yes thats the way celebrity works in america  no matter what youre known for

106 minutes as benjamin and elaine escaped in that bus at the end of the graduate\\ i cheered the first time i saw the movie what was i thinking of what did the scene celebrate doing your own thing\\ i suppose occasionally i will meet an almostadult son of friends and notice that he behaves like a mute savage in company responding to conversation with grunts and inarticulate syllables this behavior is usually accompanied by uncoordinated lurches as if he is behind the wheel of a body too big for him to drive a few years pass and this creature regains the use of his brain and speech and i see that he was passing through a phase does he look back on his earlier years in embarrassment today looking at the graduate\\ i see benjamin not as an admirable rebel but as a selfcentered creep whose putdowns of adults are tiresome anyone with average intelligence should have known in 1967 that the word plastics\\ contained valuable adviceespecially valuable for benjamin who lacks creative instincts and is destined to become a corporate drudge mrs robinson is the only person in the movie who is not playing old tapes she is bored by a drone of a husband she drinks too much she seduces benjamin not out of lust but out of kindness or desperation makeup and lighting are used to make anne bancroft look older she was 36 when the movie was made and hoffman was 30 but there is a scene where she is drenched in a rainstorm we can see her face clearly and without artifice and she is a great beauty she is also sardonic satirical and articulatethe only person in the movie you would want to have a conversation with when the movie was first released i wrote of the instantly forgettable\\ songs by simon and garfunkel history has proven me wrong they are not forgettable but what are they telling us the liberating power of rock and roll is shut out of the soundtrack the sound of music\\ plays on muzak at one crucial point the sg songs are melodic sophisticated safe they even accommodate the action halting their lyrics and providing guitar chords to underline key moments this is benjamin\s music mrs robinson alone with her vodka would twist the radio dial looking for the beatles or chuck berry

tim pigottsmith  is in charge an order is given to respond firmly communications are confused orders are distorted as they pass down the chain of command and soon rubber bullets and gas grenades are replaced by the snap of real bullets greengrass shows marchers trying to restrain a few of their fellows who are armed his film is clear however in its belief that the british fired first and in cold blood and he shows one wounded marcher being executed with a bullet in the back one of the marchers is apparently inspired by gerald donaghey whose case became famous after being wounded he was searched twice once by doctors and then taken to an army area where he died soldiers then found nail bombs in his pockets that had been overlooked in two previous searches for greengrass this is part of a desperate attempt by the army to plant evidence and justify a massacre of course there are two sides to the story of bloody sunday although the score army 14 marchers 0 is significant the greengrass view reflects both the theories and the anger of the antibritish factions and the army\s smugness after being cleared in the original investigation was only inflammatory bloody sunday is one view of what happened that day a very effective one and as an act of filmmaking it is superb a sense of immediate and present reality permeates every scene

george newbern  jane and michaels sister ryne shannon lucio and jane and jimmys two children who unhelpfully live in the taylor family home so that time past and present seem to cross in the same space the screenplay shows signs of being inspired by personal memories that still hurt and are still piling up in michaels mind fair enough but the film doesnt sort this out clearly and we experience vignettes in search of a story arc the actors are all capable dafoe is fearsome but they seem to drop in and out of the timeline as required we see literal fireflies in the garden and the frost poem supplies not only the occasion for plagiarism but the title of michaels novel  suggesting it settled old scores yes but although fireflies are exemplary embodiments of transitory life and are often evoked by writers i am never sure what they represent the poem seems to suggest fireflies emulate real stars the movie possibly suggests charles fails in emulating his son or whatever

110 minutes ossie davis  as the pompous windbag who heads the fraternal lodge let\s do it again isn\t a terribly ambitious comedy but within its limitations it works well and it\s completely good natured watching the obligatory chase and fight scenes i was struck by how much more fun they were than in a movie like last year\s freebie and the bean where the violent special effects overwhelmed the comic purpose cosby and poitier work well together and it could be theyll make their comedies an annual occasion in the last scene of this one in any event theyre speculating on putting the whammy on heavyweight fight between muhammad ali and sammy davis jr

ruben blades  does just that it forces a crisis of consciencebut it doesnt pay off it simply sets up the cops determination later in the film to bring in devaney alive both pitt and ford have criticized this film because they say it started shooting without a completed screenplay i can believe that consider that pitt while nominally the villain is seen in an attractive light while a british intelligence operative is seen as a sleazeball and yet ford fearing the sleazeball wants to kill pitt dedicates himself to bringing him in aliveso he can be brought to trial by the sleazeball for crimes the ira of course considers to be justified acts of war the moral reasoning in the film is so confusing that only by completely sidestepping it can the plot work at all

the nutty professor  theyre more often a distraction part of my mind is forever trying to see through the trick im observing that theyre usually not in the same frame at the same timeand when they are im thinking about how it was done that brief lack of focus is deadly to the concentration needed for perfect comic timing theres also a subtle failure of timing in some of the slapstick sequences as when a dead body is being dealt with toward the end slapstick doesnt consist merely of rushing around frantically it has a clockwork logic in which every element must be in position at precisely the right moment this is so hard to do that its a miracle when it works it involves almost musical cadences fierce creatures doesnt quite click still im fond of the movie i like its use of lust and greed always the most dependable elements of comedy and i like the way jamie lee curtis demonstrates how a lowcut dress can shift the balance of power in almost any room

what does alfred who becomes a very rich man think of thomas obsession most of the time he is unaware of it sometimes maddeningly he sighs with regret that he was given so many responsibilities and was denied the pleasure of an idyllic life such as thomas such thoughts are truly infuriating as old thomas hunts down old alfred for what he imagines will be a final settling of old scores  only to stumble into the poetic justice of the films happy ending this is an interesting film but i would have liked it more i think if it had been more bitter and unforgiving if someone like bunuel had directed it its strange a comedy about resentment i wonder if jaco van dormael who wrote as well as directed has another entire movie on this subject locked somewhere deep in his imagination and made this one to throw us off the track

110 minutes what frustrated me about the movie was how long it took to convince dennehy one or two of these airplane flights and any normal man would have caved in but dennehy keeps expressing doubts and fears and reservations and woods keeps talking and proving things and producing evidence after awhile i was thinking all right already the guy is guilty as sin i get the message the problem is that best seller is light on plot real light it doesn\t have a compelling story at its center only the original inspiration of the bestselling cop and the killer who wants to talk although it has no central plot it has any number of other things going on all kinds of minor characters and subsidiary relationships and heartwarming fatheranddaughter chats and fatal shootouts this is a case of a movie that has too much content but not enough subject too bad woods and dennehy are interesting to look at and if some effort had been made to surround them with an even passably interesting story best seller might have amounted to something as is it falls into that great lonely pit devoted to movies with a terrific premise and a great opening scene that sound good in a story conference but have no followthrough this also is another one of those movies that experiences total paralysis when it comes to depicting how an author does or does not perform the physical act of writing filming writing as a creative process seems to be hollywoods impossible challenge maybe somebody should offer a reward

behind the green door 1973 rated x
it doesnt work even though it has highquality camera work imaginative use of music and visual effects and marilyn chambers she is the most beautiful porno actress yet you may find her smiling out at you from the front of our ivory snow box and theres no denying that in the movies trapeze scene she qualifies as the busiest actress in porno history but the movie doesnt succeed in overcoming its explicit sexual content it gives us too many closeups without context too many joyless couplings without dramatic meaning the genius of the devil in miss jones was that the title character had a fictional reality and motivation that made the sex scenes credible as for the scenes in behind the green door the least you can say of them i suppose is that theyre incredible the plot if i may misuse the word involves a series of fantasies in which miss chambers is forced to undergo public humiliation at an orgy attended by various freaks she puts up a token resistance for about seven seconds after which we get an hour of surrender who knows it might have been more interesting if she had resisted pretty as she is miss chambers gives no clue in the movie as to whether she can act she doesnt have a single line of dialog although in the heavy breathing department she puts in the best sound effects since  therese and isabelle

but beneath the surface there are some unresolved problems in the film for one the boys speech block is a pretty serious matter and it bothers the really young children in the audience all around me there were urgent conversations going on as the kids tried to figure out why the hero couldnt talk few understood it as a psychological difficulty they thought he was either stupid or stubborn another problem is presented by sylvia syms performance as the boys mother miss syms is apparently incapable of playing the role straight as she should instead filled with the fire of a dedicated actress she rings in all sorts of quirks and nervousness these are apparently supposed to indicate her own psychological hangups and to suggest some of the reasons for the boys problems but nothing is made clear and so the mother simply appears neurotic more warmth and tenderness in the character of the mother would have been welcomed by the younger children in the audience the plot is fairly thin which doesn\t help national velvet told a story here was this young girl who loved a horse and knew it could win the grand national run wild run free since it is preoccupied with the inner difficulties of the hero has too many scenes where the boy runs off to the foggy moor and is searched for by his parents and friends until you\re fairly sure of yourself it\s no fun to see a kid in a movie get lost some of the 6 and 7yearolds didn\t like it a bit still these reservations are mostly on behalf of the younger kids and if you take yours you might try discussing the movie with them afterward to be sure they understood for older children teenagers and adults run wild run free is what it\s intended to be an absorbing family movie

daniel pyne drama sports film
rated r for strong language and some nuditysexuality
170 minutes the reason their characters arent better developed is that so much of the films running time is lost to smoke and mirrors there isnt really a single sequence of sports action in which the strategy of a play can be observed and understood from beginning to end instead stone uses fancy editing on montage closeups of colorful uniforms and violent action with lots of crunching sound effects or he tilts his camera up to a football pass spinning against the sky this is razzledazzle in the editing we dont get the feeling were seeing a real game involving these characters there\s a lot of music though and even a fairly unconvincing mtv music video for foxx to star in it\s as if stone wanted to pump up the volume to conceal the lack of onfield substance in his films like jfk\\ and nixon\\ there was a feeling of urgent need to get everything in we felt he had lots more to tell us and would if he could any given sunday\\ feels stretched out as if the story needed window dressing it\s as if the second unit came back with lots of fullframe shots of anonymous football players plowing into one another in closeup and stone and his editors thought they could use that to mask their lack of substantial strategic comprehensible sports action footage adding to the distraction is the fact that the outcome of every single play matches the dramatic needs of the script its a close call here i guess i recommend the movie because the dramatic scenes are worth it pacino has some nice hearttohearts with quaid and foxx and the psychology of the veteran coach is wellcaptured in the screenplay by stone and john logan

 and we note he is a producer of this movie how can a pickup truck contain enough mass to unfold into a towering machine i say if ringling brothers can get 15 clowns into a volkswagen anything is possible all the same the mechanical battle goes on and on and on and on with robots banging into each other and crashing into buildings and buildings falling into the street and the military firing and jets sweeping overhead and megatron and the good hero optimus prime duking it out and the soundtrack sawing away at thrilling music and enough is enough just because cgi makes such endless sequences possible doesnt make them necessary they should be choreographed to reflect a strategy and not simply reflect shapeless random violence here the robots are like tv wrestlers who are down but usually not out i saw the movie on the largest screen in our nearest multiplex it was standing room only and hundreds were turned away even the name of hasbro maker of the transformers toys was cheered during the titles and the audience laughed and applauded and loved all the human parts and the opening comedy but when the battle of the titans began a curious thing happened the theater fell dead silent no cheers no reaction whether optimus prime or megatron was on top no nothing i looked around and saw only passive faces looking at the screen my guess is were getting to the point where cgi should be used as a topping and not the whole pizza the movie runs 144 minutes you could bring it in at two hours by cutting cgi shots and have a better movie

92 minutes  does indeed freeze them and they slumber for 29 years before being thawed out the general tone of late for dinner is romanticrealistic and the bizarre cryogenic plot device rests uneasily in the midst of more plausible material the only reason for its existence  the best reason indeed for the entire first hour of this movie  is that writer mark andrus and director wd richter are fascinated by the possibility that willie and his wife could be reunited after his long deep sleep willie and frank are thawed out in a scene that feels contrived as if even the filmmakers didnt believe it and then they travel back to santa fe where willie who has only aged a day will seek out his wife and daughter who are 29 years older the possibilities are limitless and the movie at last takes life in a series of moments that have a genuine emotional strength

109 minutes here again the action scenes seem rooted in sweat and desperation too many action scenes look like slick choreography but cuaron and owen get the scent of fear and death and nobody does anything that is particularly impossible small details even in the midst of a firefight dogs scamper in the streets farons hand reaches out to touch and reassure the nearest animal and i was reminded of jack londons belief that dogs not cats so much see us as their gods apparently sterility affects only humans on earth when we are gone will the dogs still tirelessly search for us i have been using hitchcock\s term macguffin too much lately but there are times when only it will do the lack of children and the possibility of children are the macguffins in children of men inspiring all the action but the movie significantly never tells us why children stopped being born or how they might become possible again the childrenasmacguffin is simply a dramatic device to avoid actual politics while showing how the world is slipping away from civility and coexistence the film is not really about children it is about men and women and civilization and the way that fear can be used to justify a police state i admire that plot decision i would have felt let down if the movie had a more decisive outcome it is about the struggle not the victor and the climax in my opinion is openended the performances are crucial because all of these characters have so completely internalized their world that they make it palpable and themselves utterly convincing cuaron fulfills the promise of futuristic fiction characters do not wear strange costumes or visit the moon and the cities are not plastic hallucinations but look just like today except tired and shabby here is certainly a world ending not with a bang but a whimper and the film serves as a cautionary warning the only thing we will have to fear in the future we learn is the past itself our past ourselves

the movie doesnt quite live up to its promise if the implications of the 2022 society had been completely followed through the ending would have been more disturbing than it is but i suspect the ending  which comes as no great surprise  was a bow to sf convention and to the original harry harrison novel the movies based on the movie looks good a lot of money apparently was spent on it which is nothing new for director fleischer whose credits include dr dolittle and tora tora tora  about which the less said the better the most impressive scene is one of the last when robinson decides the time has come for him to die he goes to  home

clean and sober is not the story of an ideal recovery from drug or alcohol addiction because keaton is not an ideal candidate for recovery he tells too many lies especially to himself and he doesnt much like to accept advice he is still somewhat seduced by the notion that he can do some repairs on his old lifestyle and it will still work but by the end of the movie there is some hope that he may be able to get straight although the subject matter of this film is commonplace in our society  for every celebrity who checks into the betty ford center there are thousands of ordinary people who check in somewhere else or who pick up the phone and call aa everybody knows somebody like this but the actual process of surrender and recovery is hardly ever the subject of films maybe because it seems too depressing one of the strengths michael keaton brings to clean and sober is his wild tumultuous energy which makes his character seem less like a victim than like an accident causing itself to happen surrounded by superb supporting performances  especially by baker who also costarred with freeman as the prostitute in  street smart

rodriguez has always been in love with special effects as in his vampire movie from dusk \til dawn and here he combines computergeneral images with brightly colored sets that look like a riot in a paint box the movie\s props range from bubble gum which can be used as a tracking device to the parents\ car which doubles as a submarine and there\s great imagination in a scene in which the kids commandeer a combo aircraftspeedboatsubmarine with a plump fish design that looks like something captain nemo might have dreamed up with a movie so enchanting and cheerful i want to resist sociological observations but it should be noted that rodriguez has made a mainstream family film in which most of the heroic roles are assigned to hispanic characters at one point the banderas character even jokes about all the latinos on floops tv show it should also be observed that he avoids disturbing violence that the entire movie is in a cheerful kidding spirit and that the stunts and skills exhibited by the kids look fun not scary the props even the boatplanesub look like extensions of their toys not like adult inventions that have been scaled down movies like spy kids are so rare families are often reduced to attending scatological dumberanddumbest movies like  see spot run

a great many scenes in this movie i am afraid can be understood only in terms of the way the film was shot wenders gathered around him his actors and a core crew of 17 technicians flew from one city to another picked up local crews and shot on the run his longtime cinematographer robby muller  spoke of trying to maintain a certain visual consistency through framing and lighting but wenders was essentially at the mercy of local shooting conditions and many of the scenes feel as if they were altered to cope with unforeseeable circumstances there is none of the narrative urgency that would help in drawing us through to the end of the 157 minutes

94 minutes not so by the end of the film she is called upon to save the planet and all living things upon it and so she needs that strength she provides a strong center to the film but the rest of it alas is all over the map i am not even sure i completely understood all of the details what connection was there for example between the hebrew code letters with their wax seals and the dread events that followed every time one was opened what were those flashbacks to roman times who was that strange priest who traveled around the globe checking out the frozen deserts and bloody rivers and on whose side was the boarder over the garage by the end of the movie i was fairly certain of the answers to most of those questions but the body of the film seemed almost deliberately confused and obscure to no purpose why not explain the priests actual mission instead of saving it for a denouement at the last minute wouldnt that have been more interesting and why is it that only the characters in the movie seem to be aware that things are going to hell and the apocalypse is at hand to be sure cnn has nonstop bulletins about the weird events taking place in the world but nobody in the street seems much affected in fact the movies two earthquakes are not commented on by anyone  not even the leading characters and then there is the problem of the ending of the movie i have to go at this very delicately so as not to give too much away but if you see the film ask yourself this when the baby reaches out his hand toward the mothers face why doesnt he simply touch it if you see what i mean

this is a movie that literally hinges on the issue of perjury\r\nand sidney lumet and his cowriter jay presson allen  have a great deal of\r\nrespect for the legal questions involved there is a sustained scene in this\r\nmovie that is one of the most spellbinding i can imagine and it consists\r\nentirely of government lawyers debating whether a given situation justifies a\r\ncharge of perjury rarely are ethical issues discussed in such detail in a\r\nmovie and hardly ever so effectively prince\r\nof the city is a very good movie and like some of its characters it\r\nwants to break your heart maybe it will it is about the ways in which a\r\ncorrupt modern city makes it almost impossible for a man to be true to the law\r\nhis ideals and his friends all at the same time the movie has no answers\r\nonly horrible alternatives

107 minutes heironymus has arrived at the 40th year of his life studying insurance tables he arrives at the gloomy conclusion that he has less time left than hes already spent he began life with two ambitions to make it big in show business and to make love to as many a woman as is humanly and physically possible he was coached for the latter undertaking by the worlds prototype pimp good time eddie filth but even in the midst of revels planned by eddie he receives disturbing visits from an old man dressed in white the presence the presence smokes his cigar tells lousy anecdotes without a point and waits around so it seems until heironymus dies famous and rich and surrounded by women heironymus still seeks happiness he finds it or thinks he does with the virginal mercy humppe but mercy is too good too pure he returns to the arms of good time eddie filths girls thus he ends as he began seeking happiness everywhere except where he finds it newley has conceived his film in surrealistic terms most of the action takes place on a seashore somewhere where heironymus has piled up exhibits for a museum history of his life episodes are staged in the form of musichall revues all tied together by the device of heironymus autobiographical project there are interruptions financial crises halts while the writers create new dialog and eventually out of the chaos emerges    well a chaotic movie in which nothing fits together which doesnt have a proper ending is indulgently autobiographical and all that but what also emerges on reflection is a movie that sags under the weight of too much invention rather than too little the miracle is that newley is able to keep all the pieces somehow related and to get them to add up to a statement or at least a feeling about the nature of life the result may be more of a juggling feat than a directorial triumph but its a good act while its onstage

84 minutes beauty and the beast like 1989s the little mermaid reflects a new energy and creativity from the disney animation people they seem to have abandoned all notions that their featurelength cartoons are intended only for younger viewers and these arent childrens movies but robust family entertainment perhaps it is inevitable in an age when even younger kids see highvoltage special effects films like  die hard  or terminator 2 that animation could no longer be content with jolly and innocuous fairy tales what a movie like beauty and the beast does however is to give respect to its audience

123 minutes this is new ground for sembene who is the best of the handful of african film directors in such earlier films as  black girl  he attacked white racism his heroine was a senegalese girl sent as an au pair to paris and eventually forced to suicide this time he looks at a country much like senegal and the result is shockingly effective he indicts a way of life and of doing business  and at the same time exhibits a biting gift for satire despite the rather washedout color photography it\s very much worth seeing there is for example the inevitable humor of the opening scenes as the harassed middleaged businessman tries to placate his first and second wives and the shrill demanding mother of his new bridetobe there is sembenes dry witty record of a conversation between the first two wives and when the hapless businessman is impotent on his wedding night and his motherinlaw bursts into the bedroom to harangue him were reminded of bunuel sembene is particularly interested in the ways african and european cultures imperfectly coexist in a newly liberated state the businessman drives a mercedes and insists on french mineral water but takes his potency problems to a series of witch doctors one of them advises him to approach his wife on all fours while wearing halloweenstyle false teeth

they run away they hide in an abandoned warehouse by the hudson river when the commissioner reports that his daughter has been kidnapped theres a citywide search meanwhile the sleaze sisters contact the dj who takes their side and the nice girl gets a job as a stripper on 42nd st the screenplay seems to intend the two girls to learn more about themselves through their friendship but the scenes arent structured enough to make that possible the movies use of times square and its other new york locations are completely unrealistic theres no way two young girls could survive unnoticed or indeed survive at all on 42nd st if no one else spotted them the pimps would its also unlikely that the alvarado character could remain undiscovered while standing next to giant posters with her picture on them but nevermind what the movie seems to be saying is not so much that they could as that they should the dj sees them as a symbol of youthful rebellion against the enemy forces fathers doctors shrinks psychiatric wards the movies last scene is a grand gesture to this cause robin johnson with eye makeup suggesting her namesake from the comic books does a rock concert from on top of the marquee of a times square theater while hundreds of teenage girls cheer from the middle of the street so why did i still keep thinking it had promise mostly because of the screen presences of the two young actresses who were able to suggest more about their characters than the screenplay provides also because of the visual sense of the film\s director alan moyle who gets an interesting look for his film even though he\s unable to marshal his scenes into a story that develop characters times square is filled with ideas for a movie but they\ve just never been organized into a movie

103 minutes the movie settles down into the pattern of a thriller after a young cajun  michael schoeffling  is framed for a murder and hunted by an anglo mob after belizaire also is found guilty of murder there is a wonderfully written and directed scene on a scaffold where he stands between two thieves and tries to talk his way out of his predicament the plot elements in belizaire are pretty routine there\s not much to surprise us about the chase the romance the showdown what i liked about the movie was its unforced view of cajun life the rhythms of the speech as they move from cajun french into english and back again and the comic timing of some of the scenes especially two where the local sheriff tries to temper justice with fairness as belizaire assante is an interesting casting choice hes big bearded and confident but he doesnt play the cajun like an action hero he plays him sort of like a bayou version of ghandi restraining his anger always able to see the comic side of his predicament trying to talk his people out of a situation they clearly cannot win by force

we would like to hear testimony from byers about whether the other victims were then present or if his stepson later joined them and where they were later and where he was either those questions were not asked or the filmmakers decided not to use them one of the frustrating things about paradise lost is that for all the information it contains key elements are missing the three defendants for example all claim to have alibis for the night of the murder but we learn little about them the film ends with guilty verdicts against damien death by injection and jason life in prison the sentences are under appeal at the end of the film i was unconvinced of their guilt the film creates a vivid portrait of a subculture in which satan is a central figure where did damien jason and jesse hear about satanic rituals mostly in church it would appear some members of this community seem to require satanism as part of their world view they seize upon the devil to explain what dismays them their frequent theme is vengeance and it is bloodcurdling to hear relatives of the victims promise that if the defendants are released they will track them down and kill them the only person in the film who defends a traditional christian belief system is the grandfather of one victim who says he believes in forgiveness and knows he will be reunited in heaven with his loved ones the others in the room listen without comprehension we leave the film unsure about who committed the murders but convinced that an obsession with satanism extends here far beyond the circle of defendants

94 minutes to what degree incident at loch ness is truthful is something you will have to decide indeed that\s part of the fun since some scenes are either clearly real or exactly the same as if they were watching the movie is an entertaining exercise in forensic viewing and the insidious thing is even if it is a con who is the conner and who is the connee authors note the web site wwwtruthaboutlochnesscom supplies a lot of information speculation and gossip about the film not all of it necessarily trustworthy

85 minutes what was said at the story conferences for this movie were any doubts expressed or did everyone pitch in with new ideas  like the scene where the girl is hanging from the rooftop by one hand and the psychiatrist is stabbing that hand with a needle containing deadly drugs did anyone wonder if maybe there were some creative cheerful and lifeaffirming screenplays floating around did the filmmakers even recognize that their work was a commercial for death do they know any teenagers especially younger troubled ones like the ones in their movie and in their potential audience are they aware of the national epidemic of teenage suicides do they even think about such things or was this movie simply a mindless exercise in technology i ask such questions because i watched the movie with a tide of unease rising within me there is hardly a shred of hope anywhere in this film it sinks to such depths that even the heroines group therapy session turns into a grisly lottery of death with first one and then another member killing himself i am aware that teenagers go to these films and like them i have seen many similar films with teenage audiences and you can forget about the r rating because this is a movie aimed at high school and junior high school students as any honest person in the movie industry will admit almost all teenagers have a vein of low selfesteem selfdoubt and despair most of them learn to deal with it and to grow in confidence and maturity bad dreams is poison for that process like the doctor in the film whose care makes people sick or dead the makers of this film are supplying entertainment that celebrates doom

i personally doubt that anyone even an expert firefighter could actually survive in such conditions for more than a moment or two and russells exploits are especially dubious since he prefers not to wear a mask and likes to runs barefaced into hell in search of heroism but it sure plays well chicago is a big city with a lot of firefighters politicians and fire inspectors but backdraft is totally conventional as an action movie and asks us to believe that a handful of the same characters would constantly run across one another know one another have histories together and so on this limits the number of characters and makes it extremely easy for the audience to figure out who the bad guy is since there arent any extra suspects to mislead us even if he wasnt written as such a slimy scumbag that you hate him from his first appearance on screen backdraft is such a technical achievement that it will probably make its money and become a hit what i regret is that all of the expertise lavished on this movie couldnt have been put at the service of a more intelligent story about real firemen real working conditions real heroism and the real craft and art of firefighting

edward behr  in paul therouxs original novel doctor slaughter bulbeck was older and less amusing and slaughter was very alone in the world she had made for herself the love that grows between the bright young woman and the gentle middleaged man provides a subject that wasnt there in the theroux version and so its sort of a shock when the plot reintroduces itself the plot has to do with middle eastern intrigues spy rings terrorists and plans to sabotage bulbecks peace initiative and it leads to the movies closing sequences in which we lose the particular charms of the growing romance and find ourselves back in those familiar movie cliches where everything is settled with violence god its boring to have to wait through an obligatory series of scenes until all of the right people have been killed and the movie can be over the last scene in half moon street is particularly unconvincing because for a long time this movie seemed so unorthodox that i expected a tough and realistic ending in which at least one of the wrong people would get killed no such luck and so i was right the movie is interesting primarily because of the interaction between weaver and caine swaim deserves credit for the intelligence and wit of the first 80 or 90 minutes but must also take the blame for the ending which is a complete surrender to generic conventions

 promoted from his operations command in airport has a wife and daughter on the crippled plane or that we have the usual ecumenical mixture of stereotypes racial groups ages sexes and occupants on board that\s all part of the formula but at least airport 1975 introduces its characters quickly and without fuss and then gets on with the business at hand and after the midair collision which has been telegraphed for at least twenty minutes the movie\s excellent special effects become really gripping with airport you never quite felt those people were on a real plane the exterior shots looked faked airport 1975 has a much more plausible look and a lot of effective aerial photography it also gives us a compelling performance by karen black the stewardess shes probably too good an actress for a role like this but she makes it real and who could ever quite believe dean martin as the pilot in airport the only quarrel i have with the role is that it falls into the trap of assuming she\s incompetent because she\s a woman her lip quivers her eyes well up with tears she\s indecisive at key moments the men on the ground decide they have to get a real pilot on board my notion is that a real stewardess faced with such an unlikely situation would respond professionally and coolly

108 minutes weir is good with his actors and good too at putting a slight spin on some of the obligatory scenes when depardieu meets macdowells parents for example the scene doesnt develop along the standard lines of outrage and bluster instead conrad mclaren as her father grasps the situation instantly and proves to be a good judge of character i also liked the scene where depardieu goes to a party and meets macdowells friends of course they are snotty and of course it is mentioned that depardieu is a composer and of course there is a piano there and depardieu is asked to play one of his compositions but what happens then is perhaps the best scene in the movie green card is not blindingly brilliant and is not an example of the very best work of the director who made  the year of living dangerously  or the actor who starred in  cyrano de bergerac

these many strands are woven together in a clever screenplay by dan fogelman that establishes what is needed conceals what is required supplies carell with a oneliner about tomei that brings down the house and springs some omg moments all of that is the mechanism what is also nice is the feeling no one is hateful in this movie even kevin bacon as the ominous marriagewrecker david lindhagen wishes no ill emily was apparently seducible so how much can we blame him the major characters all persevere in the faith that for every person there is one true love and when you meet that person your quest is at an end  always assuming of course that your love is returned sometimes babysitters four years older than you dont get in the spirit

100 minutes the plot in other words is on automatic pilot to locate the virtues of rentacop we will have to look into the crevices where bits of style and flashes of wit have been concealed i enjoyed for example the relationship between reynolds and minnelli who work easily together and establish a bantering repartee her cynical wisecracks his bemused refusal to go along there are even a couple of moments when their relationship shades off into something more personal and more touching to suggest what this movie might have become if it had been more ambitious but it is not ambitious it wants to be a formula cop picture and not much is allowed to get in the way even the nice touches stay within the formula james remar  for example is effective as dancer a sadistic killer but effective in a way that has been established in movies for 20 years everything involving the vice lord is even more conventional such men are always effete live in sprawling mansions wear tuxedos and have armies of hired goons lurking in the shrubbery reynolds sometimes seems a bit weary of all of this as indeed he might after he is fired from the force for being a hero as nearly as i could figure out he goes to work as a departmentstore security guard masquerading as santa claus and although he tries to bring some humor to this promising situation the screenplay prevents him by rushing right to the point the cute meet between himself and minnelli

 herzog\s documentary about a man who thought he could live with bears and not be eaten and was mistaken the difference is that treadwell was a foolish romantic and these men and women are in this godforsaken place to extend their knowledge of the planet and of the mysteries of life and death itself herzogs method makes the movie seem like it is happening by chance although chance has nothing to do with it he narrates as if were watching movies of his last vacation  informal conversational engaging he talks about people he met sights he saw thoughts he had and then a larger picture grows inexorably into view mcmurdo is perched on the frontier of the coming suicide of the planet mankind has grown too fast spent too freely consumed too much and the ice cap is melting and we shall all perish herzog doesnt use such language of course he is too subtle and visionary he is nudged toward his conclusions by what he sees in a sense his film journeys through time as well as space and we see what little we may end up leaving behind us nor is he depressed by this prospect but only philosophical we came we saw we conquered and we left behind a frozen fish his visit to antarctica was not intended he warns us at the outset to take footage of fluffy penguins but there are some penguins in the film and one of them embarks on a journey that haunts my memory to this moment long after it must have ended note herzog dedicated this film to me i am deeply moved and honored the letter i wrote to him from the 2007 toronto film festival is at

action comedy western rated g
91 minutes  can be recommended i suppose for students of cinematography it\s hard sometimes to see how good directors get their camera effects because good directors are subtle but i imagine you could learn a lot about camera movement by watching how burt kennedy doesn\t get his effects it takes genius to make great comedy but it should only take competence and an elementary sense of timing to make routine comedy kennedy doesnt climb that high on the step ladder of wit anyone who knows enough about a joke to put the punch line at the end could direct a funnier movie than this one why have we deserved in 1971 a western comedy during which were supposed to laugh because the characters call a mule a jackass during which that\s interesting i was going to add another example of an unfunny joke but i couldn\t there are no more examples to be had as nearly as i can remember which is all too well the repeated pronunciation of the noun jackass and its occasional use as an adjective represent the comedic high point of the kennedy directorial style he reaches but he doesn\t grasp the movie ends with jack elam standing on the back platform of the next train out of town and telling us how the story turned out we learn that james garner did indeed marry suzanne pleshette and that the gunfighter of the title is still trying to get his boots off because maybe he is cursed to die with his boots on and hopes to save his life and what happens to elam me i go on to be a star in italian westerns he says to me he sounded wistful and a little hopeful there is something inspiring about the sight of a man who wants to improve himself

100 minutes the potential is here for a comedy that could have been hilarious but the screenplay spaces out some undeniably funny lines in too much plot business and matthew mcconaughey while admirably villainous as a lecher is not convincing as a charmer just this weekend a new michael caine movie is opening which makes me remember his alfie a performance that is to lechers as brando is to godfathers maybe the movies problem runs a little deeper its not particularly funny to hear women described and valued exclusively in terms of their function as disposable sexual partners a lot of connors dialogue is just plain sadistic and qualifies him as that part of an ass it shares with a doughnut

 1996 with snakehunters up the amazon in my bemusement every time the american tourists turned up i thought of them as visitors from the phantom hollywood revision of this material magic realism of a different sort it\s as if sayles is saying here\s what the studios would have made this movie into when the history of this century\s films are written john sayles will stand tall as a director who went his own way made his own films directed and edited them himself and operated completely outside the traditional channels of distribution and finance when we hear francis ford coppola\s lament that he has to make a john grisham film in order to make one of his own films we can only reflect that sayles has demonstrated that a director can be completely independent if he chooses men with guns is immensely moving and sad and yet because it dares so much it is an exhilarating film it frees itself from specific stories about this villain or that strategy to stand back and look at the big picture at societies in collapse because power has been concentrated in the hands of small men made big with guns i understand guns in war in hunting in sport but when a man feels he needs a gun to leave his house in the morning i fear that man i fear his fear he believes that the only man more powerless than himself is a dead man

107 minutes two trains shunting back and forth barr on one and sukowa on another an underwater shot of blood spreading an incredibly evocative sequence on what it must be like to drown and a hypnotic shot of train tracks while max von sydows voice invites us to return to europe with him and surrender our wills zentropa originally titled europa won both the directing award and a technical prize at the 1991 cannes film festival although both together did not satisfy von trier clearly thinking his film deserved the palme d\or which went to  barton fink  for a film with certain similarities he gave the jury the finger and stalked off his anger is reflected in zentropa but so is the technical mastery the jury was honoring the film is too confusing to be successful but too striking and visually beautiful to be ignored

legend  show complete technical mastery but are sometimes not very interested in psychological questions this film shows a great sympathy for human comedy however and its intriguing the way he helps us to understand whats going on inside the hearts of these two women  why they need to do what they do i would have rated the movie at four stars instead of three and a half except for one shot the last shot before the titles begin this is the catharsis shot the payoff the moment when thelma and louise arrive at the truth that their whole journey has been pointed toward and scott and his editor thom noble  botch it its a freeze frame that fades to white which is fine except it does so with unseemly haste followed immediately by a vulgar carnival of distractions flashbacks to the jolly faces of the two women the roll of the end credits an upbeat country song

i remember standing in the rain once outside a theater that was playing  last year at marienbad  now there was a movie so complex and personal no one claimed to be able to understand it not even time magazine the people coming out from the previous show were shaking their heads and admitting that they too didnt have a clue and then it was our turn to go in and be mystified every once in a while a movie like that comes along a movie youve got to see so that you too can be in the dark about it in the movies own terms this much can be said for sure it may not make you an apathetic but it will certainly age you by two hours

for language and some sexual content 95 minutes
maybe i would like dedication more if i had not seen its separate elements time and again once henry and lucy have been handcuffed together by the plot for example i know with a certainty that they will end up in love but i also know the screenplay structure requires a false dawn before the real dawn there must be an element that threatens their obligatory happiness and there is in the person of jeremy  martin freeman  her former lover now back in the picture and there must be a private problem of her own to balance henrys peculiarities and there is in the person of her mother  dianne wiest  who wants to evict her raising the specter that she will move in with the wrong person 
a womans decision  the balance 1977  nobody dies in a woman\s decision but the emotional intensity of the closing moments is strong the movie is not all that bleak maja komorowska who is polands bestknown actress projects spunk humor and resiliency in the central role theres life in her she fights back she looks kind of naive in some scenes and then terribly wise in others she has the capacity to love and give and then when things go wrong shes open enough to admit vulnerability especially in the scene at the end of the long nights wait  the scene where she opens her mouth and permits herself a mournful shout of anguish this is a movie for adults not because it has content that would be disturbing to younger viewers  although it does  but because you have to have been around for a while to understand all that krzysztof zanussi is saying

twolane blacktop 1971 drama indie
rated r 101 minutes
the movie is intended i suppose to be a metaphor but unless i missed the point it doesnt have much of anything new to tell us sophomores in literary criticism could probably decode it as a metaphor involving the kinds of characters we meet and our lack of communication with them and yet our fundamental dependency on them during lifes journey  but so what hardly anyone needs to be told that what i liked about twolane blacktop was the sense of life that occasionally sneaked through particularly in the character of gto  warren oates  he is the only character who is fully occupied with being himself rather than the instrument of a metaphor and so we get the sense weve met somebody that and some of the racing and road scenes and the visual texture of the movie make it worth seeing

as one of the richest men in america he hires eddie as an investment magician eddie loses his touch when he runs out of pills he regains it and so on de niro is not well used in the role because he plays van loon straight and in one dimension dont you suppose he could have been supplied with a quirk of his own the twist at the end comes too late bradley cooper fits well into the two versions of eddie morra and director neil burger does inventive visual effects in showing how time telescopes for eddie and the answers to problems seem to materialize before his eyes a subplot about a murder however raises questions it doesnt answer and all the quasicriminal stuff seems a little perfunctory the movie is not terrifically good but the premise is intriguing it doesnt really set out to explore what such a pill might really to do a person limitless only uses 15 maybe 20 percent of its brain still thats more than a lot of movies do

one key scene gave me problems it involves an ambulance actually it involves two ambulances which was my problem i think maybe one additional shot or one more line of dialogue might have oriented me but there for a moment it seemed as if certain characters had dropped into another dimension the plot device was explained to me by dann gire president of the chicago film critics association which is yet another reason his photograph should be displayed in every post office and schoolroom the bedrock of the plot is the dogged determination of the bruce willis character jack may be middleaged he may be tired he may be balding he may be a drunk but if hes played by bruce willis you dont want to bet against him he gets that look in his eye that says its going to be a pain in the ass for me to do this but i couldnt live with myself if i didnt i always i believe that more easily than the look that merely says

 this movie is completely different in theme and yet it has the same quiet way of developing characters the camera watches people while they gradually reveal themselves nothing is simply told to the audience for de niro murray and thurman what happens is sort of magical de niro is known for his ability to get into characters by changing himself physically and here somehow he seems to have shrunk he seems shorter more tentative murray reining in his rapidfire comic gift comes across as the kind of guy who would love to be gentle and nice but was born with the wrong genes thurman so elegant in other pictures here becomes almost mousy in some scenes glory has low selfesteem as indeed she should if she allows herself to be made into a thankyou note mad dog and glory is the kind of movie i like to see more than once the people who made it must have come to know the characters very well because although they seem to fit into broad outlines they are real individuals  quirky bothered worried bemused

what is this story really about there are a lot of possibilities from the lennieassaint theory to the feminist deconstruction that has no doubt been performed more lately the highest praise i can give the filmmakers is that none of them seem to have any theories at all they give us characters a milieu some events the central tragedy of the story is that these two men have formed a friendship that works  they have a synergy in which each takes according to his needs and gives according to his abilities  and when george isnt there lennie gets into trouble through no fault of his own and then the world slaps them down sinise says of mice and men was his favorite novel as a young man it led him to a love of steinbeck and he eventually played tom joad on stage in the famous steppenwolf production of  the grapes of wrath  then he directed his first movie  miles from home

98 minutes isaach de bankole  who seems most in danger of getting tired he is an african student in montreal who lives a relaxed and cheerful life in coffeehouses and the apartments of his friends and spends most of his free time trying to pick up girls in public places using the timehonored theory that if you proposition enough different people one of them is eventually going to say yes in the movie many of them do and he gives them nicknames miz literature miz mystic miz redhead and so on they all seem to be grateful for his attentions and occasionally the movie directly addresses the issue of sexual lore as when one of his dates is told i hear they make love like gods the word they is at the heart of my problem with the movie they in this case are africans but when the africans in the movie talk among themselves they are white people and in both cases the use of blanket racial stereotypes is routine the movie\s lead character is credited only as man and if he had a proper name in the dialogue i missed it he and his friends talk about white women in the most astonishing generalities only to have themselves discussed by white women in similar sweeping statements the sexual encounters in the movie are mostly onenight stands aids is not an issue apparently the characters are mostly promiscuous their genitals dictate their standards and their lives outside the bedroom are exercises in stupendous banality there is something a little offensive for every viewer in the fact that the black man is apparently not interested in black women nor are his white girlfriends interested in white men is it too idealistic to suggest that sincere people of all races might actually pick their romantic partners on the basis of their individual qualities and values instead of being hung up on always going with the same model as if people were automobiles the storyline of how to make love to a negro without getting tired is a meandering sort of 1960s fantasy in which the hero hopes to become a novelist and types away at his novel during the course of the film sometimes hitting three keys at the same time only to save it from a burning building at the end there are also some white racist drug dealers who hang around and utter ominous threats but seem unfocused and superfluous as if the movie thought it ought to throw in some racists and then didn\t know what to do with them and there is the potentially interesting character of bouba an african student who rooms with the hero is deeply religious and sleeps soundly through all of the sexual couplings but nothing much is really done with the character and indeed the whole movie is a series of missed possibilities and superficial characters

92 minutes its\r\nnot long after the bank hostage business that mary reveals her secret hancock\r\nstarts asking deep questions about himself and the movie takes an odd\r\npenetrating turn this is the part i wont get into except to say that the\r\norigin stories of superheroes consistently underwhelm me and hancocks is one\r\nof the most arbitrary even mary who knows all about him doesnt know all\r\nthat much and i have a shiny new dime here for any viewer of the movie who can\r\nexplain exactly how hancock came into being not\r\nthat it matters much anyway i guess he had to come into being somehow and\r\nthis movies explanation is as likely as most which is to say completely\r\npreposterous still hancock is a lot of fun if perhaps a little topheavy\r\nwith stuff being destroyed smith makes the character more subtle than he has\r\nto be more filled with selfdoubt more willing to learn jason bateman is\r\npersuasive and helpful on the pr front and it turns out charlize theron

92 minutes had in  sweet november  1968  the one with the bed under the skylight and ladders running up to lofts everywhere dustin hoffman has had it done over in white while dustin and mia are trying to find their way around this labyrinth yates shovels in lots of flashbacks to their earlier affairs she was the mistress of a state representative he dated a fashion model typical the trouble with the flashbacks is that yates wants to be fashionable and so the flashbacks segue directly into the present mia drops a glass in an airport and also in dustins kitchen dustin talks to his old girlfriend and hes talking out loud to mia after a while you realize the whole movie is based on the premise that the characters unconsciously talk aloud all the time even when they dont think they are is my guess

106 minutes  doesnt miss a single opportunity to generate emotion from its story theres the girls 16th birthday party where nobody comes the lonely christmas eve the crush that jenny gets on a sincere young preppie and the way her mother embarrasses her by dancing with the waiter at a posh florida resort what stella proves is that no scene is really hackneyed or predictable unless the people making the movie think of it that way midler and alvarado put so much belief into their scenes so much unforced affection and life that only an embittered grinch could refuse to be touched in an odd sort of way some of the same notes in stella were played not so well in midler\s previous tearjerker  beaches  1989 that one was more sophisticated and cool and knowledgeable and not half as effective

robert elswit and the editing of stuart baird and john gilroy the movie has a great many chase scenes and faithful readers will know that these in general have lost their novelty for me but a good chase scene is a good chase scene it demands some sense of spatial coherence no matter how impossible some continuity of movement no matter how devised by stuntwork and effects and genuine interest for the audience its in that area that angelina jolie really delivers she brings the conviction to her role that such a movie requires she throws herself into it with animal energy somehow improbably she doesnt come off as a superhero although her immunity suggests one but as a brave and determined fighter how does she look she looks beautiful by default and theres a scene in an office where she looks back over her shoulder to talk with schreiber and you think oh my but neither jolie nor noyce overplays her beauty and she gets gritty and bloody and desperate and we get involved

75 minutes like the people in nina paley\s  sita sings the blues  these images move mostly from back and forth within the same plane which is only correct since perspective hasn\t yet created spatial dimension but there\s no feeling of limitation indeed in a season where animated images hurl themselves from the screen with alarming recklessness i was grateful that these were content merely to be admired the movie has a wide appeal with a gap in the middle i think it will appeal to children young enough to be untutored in boredom and to anyone old enough to be drawn in or to appreciate the artistry for those in between the  transformers

108 minutes  once the message is received and basinger arrives on earth the film picks up she has learned about humans by studying television shows from the 1950s and so her dialogue sounds a little strange but a woman who looks like basinger can go to a party on the beach and say almost anything and the men will nod approvingly and tell her she\s made a good point her mission is to convince the aykroyd character to repeat his experiment so her home planet can be saved from some kind of gravity drain but she doesn\t expect him to fall in love with her and that causes complications basingers gimmick is a purse that is able to manufacture such items as dresses and id cards it also contains a snake with an eyeball for a mouth which is her traitorous sidekick the purse is a key prop in the movies best scene where aykroyd wants to kiss and the purse projects movies on the wall behind him so that basinger can copy her technique from old movies and other even stranger sources another big scene has basinger serving breakfast to akyroyd and his daughter and filling the table with everything from the menu at the corner restaurant this scene should have worked but somehow it doesnt it seems flat and benjamin cant find a way to give it a spin aykroyd is a solid presence in the movie but hes the straight man the earthling who likes to slave over a hot computer and cant believe this woman really loves him basinger gets most of the good comic moments in the movie and does with them what she can but benjamin and his writers seem to have run short of invention most of the plot developments are forgone conclusions and most of the big set pieces like a wedding are handled routinely without inspiration

95 minutes mitchell electrifies the movie with a performance that isn\t a satire of glamrock performers so much as an authentic glamrock performance the movie may have had a limited budget but the screen is usually filled with something sensational including a trailer home that transforms itself in an instant into a stage michael pitt\s performance as tommy is all the more astonishing if you\ve recently seen him as i did playing donny the overgrown tough kid in bully this material could have been glib and smug but it isn\t there\s some kind of pulse of sincerity beating below the glittering surface and it may come from mitchell\s own life story he was raised in berlin as the son of the general in charge of the us military garrison there the defense secretary at the time was dick cheney did they discuss their gay children the fall of the berlin wall must have made an impression on young mitchell as did also the wild nightlife scene in berlin and in a way the movie is about a collision between those two inspirations the filmmaking is as freeform as such movies as pink floyd the wall there\s an animated sequence to illustrate one of the songs and a bouncing ball for a singalong and the musical numbers spill out from behind the salad bar to become as exuberant as something from mgm hedwig stands astride the material sometimes literally and it\s interesting that the character is presented as someone whose sex change was not eagerly sought but seemed to be a necessary byproduct of love does hedwig really want to be a boy or a girl and what about yitzhak  miriam shor  who may be her boyfriend although the movie doesnt say for sure strange how the movie seems to be loud flashy and superficial and yet gives a deeper dimension to its characters

103 minutes haskell wexler  who has photographed this movie with great beauty and precision have ennobled the material there is a scene where a person numbed by the cold sea is warmed between two cows and we feel close to the earth and protected one can easily guess how this legend could have been simplified and jollied up in other hands  how it could have been about cute little selkies but legends are after all told by adults not children and usually they record something essential to the culture that produces them what this legend says i think is that the people who tell it live on the land but live from the sea so that their loyalties are forever divided of course this is a wonderful family film if that term has not been corrupted to mean simpleminded and shallow children deserve not lesser films but greater ones because their imaginations can take in larger truths and bigger ideas the secret of roan inish is a film for children and teenagers like fiona who can envision changing their family\s fate it is also for adults of course except for those who think they do not want to see a film about anything so preposterous as a sealwoman and who will get what they deserve

 sneaking in material he likes even though it doesnt pay its way theres one other cultural reference in the movie unless im seeing it where none was intended early in the film the boys blow up a telephone pole in order to calculate when it will fall and they stand just inches into the safe zone i was reminded of buster keaton  standing so that when a wall fell on him he was in the exact outline of an open window the movie has qualities that cannot be denied jena malone  donnie darko  life as a house has a solemnity and selfknowledge that seems almost to stand outside the film she represents the gathering weather of adulthood the boys are fresh and enthusiastic and we remember how kids can share passionate enthusiasms the animated sequences perfectly capture the energy of their imaginary comic book vincent d\onofrio muses through the film on his own wavelength making of father casey a man who means well but has little idea what meaning well would consist of if the film had been less extreme in the adventures of its heroes more willing to settle for plausible forms of rebellion that might have worked it tries too hard and overreaches the logic of its own world

socialist dogma coexists with glenn miller records and the beginnings of rock \n\ roll and the four form their own band to mimic the precious pop records that slip in from western europe they also each in his own way pay court to esther a pretty girl who loves each one of them just for being himself  something the boys egos will not let them understand each one wants to be esthers lover each one is turned down and there is some heavyhanded symbolism in which the act of smoking is made into a badge of manhood since the movie begins with a funeral it drips incessantly with nostalgia every happy moment we see is shadowed by the knowledge that it took place in the old days that all the good times are past and gone i wonder how this same material would have played if the story had been told from beginning to end perhaps it would have been jollier certainly it would have seemed more spontaneous

tom hanks  he was the guy from  splash  who the mermaid fell in love with i didn\t think he was all that terrific in splash  i thought he was miscast and they should have gone for somebody who was less of a conventional leading man  but in bachelor party he\s a lot more funny and i enjoyed the performance he plays the kind of guy who goes over to his fiance\s house for dinner and drops table scraps onto the floor in case they have a dog he has a great oneliner when he has to introduce himself to his fiance\s nerdy exboyfriend the name is bond james bond during the chaos of the party itself one of his primary roles is simply to direct traffic the idea during the party i think is to approximate the spirit of one of those jack davis drawings in mad magazine where dozens of people are running around like crazy and down in the corners you can see strange little figures doing inexplicable things most of the gags depend on varieties of public embarrassment and some of them are pretty funny especially when the women decide to have their revenge by visiting a male gogo bar

richard linklater  the director and cowriter but the film as a whole seems drained of thrust and energyespecially compared to his earlier films linklater is the talented maker of slackers\\ dazed and confused\\ before sunrise\\ and the underrated suburbia\\ those have all been pigeonholed as genx movies although there\s a wide range of material what none of them lack is energy he\s intensely involved in the lives of his characters whether the preppies of before sunrise\\ or the losers hanging out in a stripmall parking lot in suburbia\\ he just doesn\t seem as interested in the newton boys sure they were great bank robbersbut their very success may help explain why their legend hasn\t placed as high on the charts as dillinger baby face nelson or pretty boy floyd they were efficient professionals and the movie sits there on the screen like a biopic of traveling salesmen who crack safes instead of prospects the most entertaining footage comes at the end during the credits when we see the real willis newton in his 80s being interviewed by johnny carson and see scenes from a home movie interview with the real joe newton willis makes a spirited defense of their trade to carson since the insurance companies were crooks too and since the banks always exaggerated the amount of their losses he says it was just one thief astealing from another\\

bride flight takes this melodrama and adds details of period of behavior of personality to somewhat redeem its rather inevitable conclusion the key figure is ada who has three children and then arrives at a momentous decision which colors everything else that happens esther and marjorie find that their own decisions are not so easily left in the past you can sense i\m not describing much of the story it wouldn\t be fair a film like bride flight works because we want to see it unfolding we observe the pieces going into place and want to see how it will all work out that it works out more or less inevitably is to be expected i suppose but you\d be upset if i revealed some of the twists and turns this is the biggestbudgeted film ever made in the netherlands not least because the story of the real bride flight is wellknown and involves a period fraught with emotion so considerable is the production that rutger hauer has returned to dutch films after almost 30 years to play the older frank the young actresses who play the three leads are all capable and karina smulders much more than that in a role that takes her deeper than the others

 who uses a seemingly simple style to make some quiet and deep observations what happens to polly in the movie is easy to anticipate she learns to trust in mermaids what happens to gabrielle is that she is closely observed and skillfully dissected when the movie is over we leave thinking of polly and i have even read reviews in which the movie is treated entirely as pollys story that is partly because of mccarthys extraordinary performance in the role she has one of those faces that speaks volumes and she is able to be sad without being depressing funny without being a clown she strikes just the right offcenter note for the narration of the film she must not seem to sure of herself because the movie must not seem too sure of what it wants to say it works by indirection and polly is actually only the instrument for the real story here of a lonely and proud woman whose surfaces are flawless but whose sadness is deep if you see this movie and then have occasion to read the love song of j alfred prufrock which contains lines that strike some readers with the force of a blow reflect that the narrator of the poem is more like gabrielle than polly more like the curator who has measured out her life in coffee spoons who has seen the moment of her greatness flicker who lacks the strength to force the moment to its crisis who grows old polly is i suspect intended to be out there with the mermaids neither stupid nor mistaken but a saint

of the actors i especially enjoyed john malkovich he has a way of conveying his reasoning by shorthand and implication he creates a portrait of horse trainer who\s slow to tip his hand which is correct no role in mike rich\s screenplay is overwritten or tries to explain too much like  the social network  another contender for yearend awards it has supreme confidence in its story and faith that we will find it fascinating this is one of the year\s best films

for strong language sexual content and violence 103 minutes
what\s interesting about the players club is how it moves through various tones and kinds of material there\s the documentary stuff the crime story diana\s shaky romance with a new boyfriend ebony\s problems and comic relief from the stylized dialogue of dollar bill and his doorman l\il man aj johnson and then a strong underpinning of economic reality as diana works hard to pay her bills and is encouraged by a professor after she finds herself falling asleep in class the movie has strong scenes for all its major characters including a boozy afterhours party thrown by some federal agents who hire ronnie and some of the other girls as strippers ronnie knows these guys from earlier parties and plays the role of dominatrix slapping one officer on the behind with a paddle she says that\s one more for rodney king the scene develops interestingly at first we think ronnie may be in danger and when we see she knows what she\s doing ice cube resists the temptation to go for a comic putdown of the agents and stays instead with the real tension of the tables being turned the scene\s effect depends on the way wilson plays it a less convincing performance and we wouldn\t buy it the movie doesnt preach but it has values it sees the players club as a job and the women there as workers not sex objects its work that pays well but at a price and although diana has rules about drugs and sex ebony seems like an excellent candidate to crash and burn i liked ice cubes ambition in writing so many colorful characters and juggling them all at the same time

104 minutes maybe im wrong but i think this basic situation would have worked better as a simple human story instead of being tricked up with so many hollywood formulas and gimmicks the whole business of the car and the chase and the danger that pfeiffer puts haysbert in is all essentially just screenwriting we grow impatient at the contrivance we want the people not twists and turns and yet there are real qualities to this movie not least michelle pfeiffers performance which takes a woman who could have become a comic target and invests her with a certain dignity within her limitations and almost against her nature she grows and changes during these few days and will never be the same again the haysbert character is also carefully drawn as a southern black man of 30 years ago who is acutely aware of the racism and danger she hardly seems to notice some of the best lines in don roos screenplay involve pfeiffer making blithe assumptions about the nature of american reality and haysbert adding quiet subtle footnotes seeing this film for the second time i was more than ever aware however that the essential truth of the characters was being undercut by all the manufactured gimmicks of the plot the ancient formula for a movie in trouble was cut to the chase nothing has changed and when love field turns from an odyssey into a chase it loses its way by the end the kennedy funeral which should provide the whole focus is really only a mcguffin

courteney cox well known from tv rarely gets an opportunity to revise her famous image but here she is serious inward coiled she carries the film the other characters circulate through her consciousness as possibilities and hypotheses the opening scenes are dark with bluegreen lightning and then later the film seems to break into red and black i was reminded of the mother of this technique the moment in bergman\s  persona  when the film breaks and must repair itself the one thing the film does not provide is an explanation at 73 minutes it barely has time to pose its questions let alone answer them but answers would be beside the point when reality seems to splinter there is only one answer and it is reality has seemed to splinter any other explanation for example a speech by the psychiatrist or the cop explaining exactly what has really happened would be contrivance better to allow november to descend into confusion and despair ah but the final segment of the film is subtitled acceptance and we are reminded that acceptance is the fifth of elizabeth kublerross\s five stages of dying the others are denial anger bargaining and depression it is useful to note that kublerross does not define acceptance as a happy stage it is simply an end of resistance to death

101 minutes did i enjoy this movie only in a dumb mindless way it has whatever made the original  xxx  entertaining but a little less of it does it make the slightest sense of course not its significance has nothing to do with current politics and politicians the threat of terrorism and the efficiency of bullet trains it has everything to do with a seismic shift in popular culture

96 minutes but\r\nwhere the buffalo roam is a celebration of the selfcreated public\r\nlegend of hunter thompson with no insights or hints into the dark night of\r\nhis soul that\s a legitimate approach and there are times during the movie\r\nwhen it works there are really funny moments here as when we learn that\r\nthompson\s dog has been trained to go berserk at the mention of nixon or when\r\nthompson covers the super bowl by staging a football game in his hotel suite\r\nor when he pulls a gun on a telephone or turns a hospital room into an orgy\r\nor attempts to impersonate a correspondent from the washington post an amazing\r\nnumber of these scenes are inspired by real life  although it was sen george\r\nmcgovern not richard nixon who found himself being interviewed by thompson\r\nwhile standing at a urinal we\r\nlaugh at a lot of these moments this is the kind of bad movie that\s almost\r\nworth seeing but there are large things wrong with where the buffalo\r\nroam one of them is its depiction of the relationship between thompson and\r\nlazlo that\s what the movie is supposed to be about and yet we never discover\r\nwhy these two characters like one another what is their relationship aside\r\nfrom the coincidence that they happen to get stoned or drunk together in\r\nbizarre circumstances are they even really friends because the movie\s\r\ncentral relationship just isn\t there the events don\t matter so much we get\r\nbizarre episodes but no insights the\r\nother problem is that the dr thompson character never seems to really feel the\r\neffects of the chemicals he hurls so recklessly at his system murray plays\r\nthompson well but in a mostly onelevel performance he walks through the most\r\ninsane situations with a quizzical monotone a gift for understatement a\r\ndruginduced trance any real person drinking and drugging like thompson would\r\nhave an occasional high and a more than occasional disastrous low here he has\r\nneither

115 minutes there are some moments when the movies mythmaking becomes selfconscious in one scene for example the marshals gunmen enter a restaurant and empty their guns into the chair where eastwood had been sitting moments before he is no longer there cant they see that in the final shootout the preacher has a magical ability to dematerialize confounding the bad guys and one shot of a hand with a gun emerging from a water trough should have been eliminatedit spoils the logic of the scene but pale rider is over all a considerble achievement a classic western of style and excitement many of the greatest westerns grew out of a director\s profound understanding of the screen presence of his actors consider for example john ford\s films with john wayne and henry fonda

whats disappointing about the movie is that it never really delivers on the subject of recovery from addiction there are some incomplete dimly seen unrealized scenes in the rehab center and then desultory talk about offscreen aa meetings but the film is preoccupied with gossip were encouraged to wonder how many parallels there are between the streep and maclaine characters and their originals fisher and debbie reynolds  suzanne the young actress has some bad moments and then comes through as a trouper and the movie almost seems to think her real problem is an inability to communicate with her mother half the people in hollywood seem to have gone through recovery from drugs and alcohol by now and yet no one seems able to make a movie thats really about the subject do they think it wouldnt be interesting any movie that cares deeply about itself  even a comedy  is interesting its the movies that lack the courage of their convictions the ones that keep asking themselves what the audience wants that go astray

the camera essentially watches this process without significant cutting for more than 30 minutes often from an awkward vantage point that prevents us from clearly seeing it still you might say we are privileged we are inside the shamaness\ yurt portable house seeing a ceremony few if any westerners have ever seen before yes i reply but we saw a very similar scene in the first part of the film if ottinger wants to repeat herself she might explain what is different about this second sequence but her subtitles are not helpful the preceding scene is subtitled poem about a chief who cannot make decisions but the lines of the poem remain untranslated at some point a documentarian risks crossing a line between an unwillingness to cut and an inability to judge ottinger crosses that line in this segment of the film i think she essentially shows us everything still once we leave the shamaness the film becomes as haunting as the first two segments were we arrive for example at the forgotten trading centers of hadhal and hanch  port cities that were busy when the soviet union thrived with the comings and goings of merchant ships but the ussr has collapsed and the sea trade with it these ports service just one arrival a year a merchant ship that tows two others behind it the shots of this crippled flotilla are a stark image of the collapse of a nation\s economy the people live off the land in addition to their herds of reindeer sheep and bison which provide milk meat skins and fur they eat roots bark berries herbs wild onions and grains there is a sequence where they thump on the ground with poles listening for the hollow sign that betrays the burrows of the suslik  a tunneling squirrel that stockpiles groundroot when they find a burrow they rob it and then the camera tilts up to the mountain vastness that surrounds them other sequences show a silversmith a wedding palace an amusement park and an old lady who is visibly impatient with the camera large herds why should there be so many ten or 20 reindeer do they give milk why should they give much milk what is there to be cheerful about i can hardly move my limbs leaving the theater after seeing all three parts of taiga i felt i was in possession of some portion of the lives of these people as i wrote this they are in the winter camps we saw them trekking toward perhaps preparing groundroot they stole from the tunneling susliks maybe the old woman has died maybe she is still complaining

the whole project seems to have been enveloped in a miasma of good intentions and heartwarming sentiments theres no edge no bite and none of the inspired body language that made vice versa so special the movie makes no attempt to really imagine what it would be like to inhabit another body it just springs the gimmick on us and starts unreeling its sitcom plot although burns is of course a beloved institution and any opportunity to see him is welcome he is not given much to do in the movie and he doesnt do much with it his character essentially is recycled from his old material and his patented talkshow gags we hear him sing his 1980 hit i wish i were 18 again of course and that is fun but we also have to hear him recite that tired old line about how he would date women his age if there were women his age no real effort has been made to find any differences between burns and the character he plays in this movie

80 minutes herzog has had two careers as the director of some of the strangest and most fascinating features of the last 30 years and some of the best documentaries many of his docs are about obsessed men the skijumper steiner for example who flew so high he overjumped his landing areas or herzog himself venturing onto a volcanic island to interview the one man who would not leave when he was told the volcano would explode herzog sees his mission as a filmmaker not to turn himself into a recording machine but to be a collaborator he does not simply stand and watch but arranges and adjusts and subtly enhances so that the film takes the materials of denglers adventure and fashions it into a new thing you meet a person who has an amazing story to tell and you rarely have the time to hear it or the attention to appreciate it the attendants in nursing homes sit glued to their stephen king

such a gorgeous kid like me 1973 rated r
98 minutes but then came such a grogeous kid like me which seems to have been halfinspired by truffaut\s wellknown fascination for crime and halfdestroyed by its tendency toward predictable farce the movie is about one camille bliss who is serving a sentence for murder murder in fact seems to follow her about through a series of bets with fate she has contrived the circumstances under which her father a motherinlaw and even a ratexterminating lover have met their ends camille is visited in prison by murene a sociologist who wants to do a thesis on criminal women little does he suspect what camille wants to do with him anyway shes sort of a tart loud and vulgar and she starts in with gusto to recount her career in crime the more he learns of her the more hes fascinated until they fall in love and he dedicates himself to proving her innocent of her last crime a suitor had unhappily fallen from a church toweror was pushed in the course of his campaign he finds some home movies that prove her innocent but they\re in the hands of a precocious 10yearold director who won\t let them be seen until he\s edited them this scene is genuinely funny to be sure but i wonder if truffaut ever saw that classic short a day with timmy page in which another precocious 10yearold expounds on his cinematic theories and his differences with fellini

mr johnson bears a strong resemblance to the accommodating indian in black robe who also leaves one group without finding a home in another perhaps that was the theme that attracted beresford  the unhappy fate of those caught between cultures in irreconcilable conflict he must also have been intrigued by the fate of father laforgue the bluteau character who lacks the words to reason with another young frenchman who falls in love with an indian woman and who has the will but perhaps not the strength to withstand the tortures of the iroquois when he and his companions are captured black robe is a film of enormous interest for those who care about the early history of europeans in north america but for ordinary moviegoers it will be very tough going it is a much more rigorous and despairing work than a novel like willa cathers shadows on the rock which tells the story of the french in quebec with serenity and an unshakable faith in human nature and at the end there is no deliverance i will not reveal the conclusion of the film other than to say that when it was over i sat there in a state of depressed suspension wondering if that could possibly be all there was

robert rodriguez action crime thriller
rated r for sustained strong stylized violence nudity and sexual content including dialogue
124 minutes frank miller and quentin tarantino are credited as codirectors miller because his comic books essentially act as storyboards which rodriguez follows with ferocity and because he was on the set every day interacting with the actors tarantino because he directed one brief scene on a day when rodriquez was determined to wean him away from celluloid and lure him over the dark side of digital it\s the scene in the car with owen and del toro who has a pistol stuck in his head tarantino also contributed something to the culture of the film which follows his influential  pulp fiction  in its recycling of pop archetypes and its circular story structure the language of the film both dialogue and narration owes much to the hardboiled pulp novelists of the 1950s which brings us finally to the question of the movie\s period skylines suggest the movie is set today the cars range from the late 1930s through the 1950s to a recent ferrarithe costumes are from the trench coat and gstring era i don\t think sin city really has a period because it doesn\t really tell a story set in time and space it\s a visualization of the pulp noir imagination uncompromising and extreme yes and brilliant

120 minutes kevin\rcostner obviously decided to play his character as a pokerfaced outsider not\rentirely human and although thats a logical choice it isnt a very\rentertaining one mel gibson  in a similar role as mad max went for energy and\rgood humor and was more fun there is also a certain lack of imagination in\rthe story these floating people have the whole globe to explore but they seem\rto hang out in the same small patch of sea with the same characters are there\rdifferent cultures elsewhere different adaptations to the flood the movie\rdoesnt care it\s\rsaid waterworld\s first cut was a good deal longer than its final\r120minute running time and you can sense that occasionally as when the\rmariner fights off an attack by the smokers and then immediately takes helen on\rthe trip beneath the sea when it seems the smokers must still be in sight but\rbasically the movie plays smoothly as a combination of chases fights bizarre\rlocations special effects and the cold distant slowly thawing behavior of\rmariner toward his passengers i\ll remember some of the sights in\rwaterworld for a long time but i won\t necessarily want to see\rthem again

drama foreign 105 minutes
the world of greek tragedy is after all at a tremendous historical distance from us and a slight distancing in the trojan women might not have been a bad thing i do not agree with the liberal humanists who say that euripides speaks to us as our contemporary if he did more people would listen but instead of approaching the trojan women with a slight bit of supernatural awe cacoyannis seems to have tried to bring us an allstar euripides for mass consumption the dialog is in english the edith hamilton translation which means that words are spoken that should really be read the elevation of classical language works on the stage but not in the more intimate medium of film we are too close to hecubas dusty face and saddened old eyes to ever believe she could choose her words so carefully and so the words finally take over and smother the tragedy everyone tries you could not possibly find a better cast than hepburn redgrave bujold and papas but you could find a better way to employ them i think here they are too selfconscious cacoyannis photographs them as icons theyre historical statues vanessa redgrave as andromache seems to be playing the idea of a woman who has had her little son murdered rather than an actual mother in such a situation katharine hepburns hecuba is the distillation of an old woman moved by pride and rage but she is not a particular woman in a specific time the performances all seem too objectified too generalized  all except irene papas as helen of troy who flaunts her body and teases her guards and takes a haughty bath in a bowl of water while the women outside thirst in the sun this helen we believe could possibly have inflamed mens imaginations and caused the destruction of troy but the other trojan women seem to be elected officials  the municipal mourners  rather than human beings consumed with passion

oh and we should also ask 5 in that scene where peppino sends the hookers home and slips in next to valerio in bed what goes on something happened between you didn\t it screams deborah at a moment when things are going badly is it a weakness or a strength of the film that we don\t know what happened a little of both as we puzzle over valerio an ingenue who when he\s not with the one he loves loves the one he\s with  if he loves anybody the movie is set mostly in italian beach towns but in a gray season against cold concrete skies the sea is distant and cheerless and garrones visuals drain the life out of some scenes this is not a comedy or a sex romp but a curious business involving two singleminded hunters peppino and deborah and their quarry whose good looks may have made life so easy for him that he never got the knack of living it elisabetta rocchetti is ideally cast as deborah because she has such a palpable acquisitive sexuality but the movies center of energy is ernesto mahieux as peppino i mentioned danny devito earlier not for the obvious reason that hes short like mahieux is but because both men dominate every scene theyre in and convince us they can impose their will on any situation it may seem unlikely that a balding middleaged midget could lure a theoretically straight young male out of the arms of a sexual tigress but after deborah sizes up peppino she knows she has to take him seriously what the little man wants he goes after with craft cunning and enormous need and its fascinating to watch him operate

more to the point the solution to the crime hardly seems to be the point of the movie it reaches for a far loftier philosophical subject which is i think the possibility of miracles although the movie deals in the basic materials of a criminal investigation cynical cops forensic details courtroom testimony it has a seriously clouded agenda the mechanism of the crime story whirls busily and goes nowhere meanwhile we learn that fonda has a personal hatred of the catholic church that mother miriam seems overly concerned with protecting sister agnes that sister agnes herself has the sort of ecstatic worldvision usually reserved for saints and that we should not overlook the possibility that the baby in fact had no father in other words sister agnes had a virgin birth or in case the point still seems obscure the murdered infant was a child of god there is a certain amount of pressure on the fonda character an agnostic to accept the possibility that a miracle has occurred she resists it quite sensibly since the implications of the miracle are horrifying if god indeed conceived the child in sister agnes womb then why did he in his omnipotence allow her to kill it but of course you argue god also gave sister agnes free will so she was free to kill the child no matter what the details of its conception true and yet then we must ask why did god create a baby to be killed here we enter of course into the still larger question of why god has created all of us and placed us in this life where we will most assuredly all die religion centers on the answers to that question the infuriating thing about agnes of god is that it tells a story that makes such questions essential and then ignores them this is a very badly confused movie it takes the form of a murder investigation and then uses hints of the supernatural to avoid all the hardedged questions raised by the murder then just when it seems to be edging close to the fundamental supernatural questions it contains  it\s back to the courtroom the movie uses each half of its story to avoid dealing with the other

118 minutes the earlier film focuses more on prefontaines stubborn battle with the amateur athletic union and other amateur bodies that essentially dictated the terms under which americans could run it makes it clear that a late invitational meet in oregon with finnish athletes was held as a deliberate challenge to the amateur establishment townes film is less quirky more a conventional sports movie but it benefits by giving more attention to the relationship between pre and bowerman and sutherland\s performance is the film\s treasure watching the way he gently tries to direct his headstrong young star we are seeing a version of phil jackson\s zen and the art of coaching what do you think a track coach does pre he asks at one point since pre seems to think the coach\s primary function is to frustrate him sutherland brings a deep patience to bowerman who understands that running is a matter of endurance and strategy as well as heart men of oregon i invite you to become students of your events pre thinks heart is enough and explains his success simply i can endure more pain than anyone you\ve ever met the film follows pre from his early sports failures he was no good at football and into running where he quickly drew attention the earlier film points out that his legs were short for a runner and of unequal length this one sees him more as naturally gifted but heedless with his talent we follow his progress from record to record and from girlfriend to girlfriend mary marckx played by monica potter  is the true love but he shuts her out of his life everything leads up to the 1972 munich olympics marred by the terrorist attack on israeli athletes

race itself is not the issue in flirting however the movie is a comingofage drama and comedy about the ways in which these two young people balance lust with mutual respect and how the girl who is wiser and more mature is also enormously tactful in guiding and protecting the boy she loves there is a scene in which they explore one another sexually but it is not a sex scene in any conventional sense of the term and the way it is handled is a rebuke to the way so many movies cheapen physical love flirting came to me out of the blue without advance notice and i was deeply affected by it then i discovered it is a sequel to an earlier australian film the day my voice broke unseen by me and that danny will be seen again in a third film still to be made by the writerdirector john duigan  i have gone searching for the first film which i remember having heard good things about but i know from experience that it is possible to see flirting all by itself

the film itself is not up to the contributions of its stars a little more thought would have helped from the quiltingbee music that plays during the fight scenes to the fallacy of the talking killer this is a movie that has been created by the numbers the fallacy i refer to of course is the frequent mistake of allowing the bad guy to talk too long he has his enemy trapped theres no way out all he has to do is plug him between the eyeballs and order lunch but no he talks and talks and sets up some kind of dumb test of manhood which he is sure to fail because the climax of such a scene is a foregone conclusion the ftk almost always results in dead screen time other elements in the film are more interesting the use of the aborigine characters for example the night san giacomo must save a baby from the wild dogs and alan rickmans performance as the villain he has a polished grace that serves here to suggest evil dimensions just beneath the surface i also enjoyed in a visceral way the pleasures of seeing the visual beauties of a western the choreography of a gunfight in rocky foothills the excitement of a chase on horseback the ambushes and close calls and treks through the desert land quigley down under is a handsome film wellacted and it\s a shame the filmmakers didn\t spend a little more energy on making it smarter and more original

 who died in 1989 and who is seen here through old shots recycled into a new character a posthumous performance makes a certain sense given the nature of dr totenkopf theres something ghoulish about using a dead actors likeness without his knowledge and in the past ive deplored such desecrations as the fred astaire dustbuster ads but surely every actor on his deathbed entering the great unknown hopes he has not given his last performance sky captain will probably not inspire the universal affection of a film like indiana jones in part because steven spielberg

99 minutes after two hours of this there are still a number of important questions the movie hasnt answered did they really love each other in the first place do they love each other now even if he does love her which seems possible does he respect her is this movie about love anyway lemmons character is given so much schtick that a human personality would have been superfluous hes got so many idiosyncrasies and strange ways of saying things and odd little personal habits that we cant see the man inside and half the time we dont know whether to laugh or not the movie has some scenes that are played very soberly others that are played for broad laughs and some which are so bizarre they dont seem to fit yet the movie has its moments lemmon has invested 30000 in the girls bond if she skips town hes broke and so he refuses to trust her he handcuffs her to beds locks her in rooms has her bang on a pipe every so often so he knows shes there she keeps wandering off  not so much to escape as to bug him and their life is further complicated by the hapless crainpool  james woods  who plays lemmons office assistant lemmon insists that crainpool wear a green eyeshade and a ragged sweater and in general do an imitation of bob cratchet and woods is so good at it that his character is simultaneously inspired and impossible i guess that would also describe the best parts of the movie

stick together and although there is a cute dog at least its made useful in the plot of course the movie makes full use of the shock shot where a zombie suddenly appears in foreground from out of nowhere of gore and blood there is a sufficiency when the survivors devise a risky way to escape from the mall which i will not reveal a chainsaw plays a key role the survivors take chances that are probably unwise maybe they should stay in a safe place since the zombies will presumably sooner or later run out of gas but taking chances makes for good action scenes and exploding propane is always useful so yes dawn of the dead works and it delivers just about what you expect when you buy your ticket my only complaint is that its plot flatlines compared to the 1979 version which was trickier wittier and smarter romero was not above finding parallels between zombies and mall shoppers in the new version the mall is just a useful location although at least there are still a few jokes about the muzak

it wouldnt be fair to describe more of what happens weve been rather expecting it and the way the writerdirector fernando leon de aranoa handles it is effective and holds a series of surprises simply on the story level amador could have been a better film but his pacing is off time and again we get languid closeups of marcela as the cogs turn in her mind and she arrives belatedly at fairly obvious conclusions it might have been possible to produce a much better film just by tighter editing the symbolism mostly involving flowers which we prize for their beauty even when they\re dead is pretty obvious so also the sea and sky and speculation about mermaids a late disclosure from the unloving daughter yolanda provides an ending that is heartless ironic and happy all at the same time

the most underwritten character is lavinias husband raymond the movie doesnt know what to do with him they let him be a little surprised a little shocked a little too straight but mostly he just stands there waiting for dialogue that is never supplied comic opportunities were lost here and the geoffrey rush character while more filled in also seems oddly unnecessary i can easily imagine the movie without him and with more about the family in phoenix he is not and never will be a workable life partner for suzette no matter how the movie tries to sentimentalize him what goldie hawn does is to play suzette sincerelyas if she really were a groupie who still holds true to her partying past her daughter kate hudson  of course played the groupie penny lane in  almost famous

 she is young and healthy and touchingly naive but what about the guy who falls in love with her its here that the movie makes its catastrophic casting mistake you see they figured they have a comedy as long as the girl has a tail and a romance whenever she has legs so they gave her a romantic leading man when they should have given her a lonely guy who could swim the leading man is tom hanks  he is conventionally handsome and passably appealing and he would do in a secondary role hed be great for example as the straightarrow brother instead they make him the mermaids lover and they cast john candy as the brother

dana stevens has some surprises and this doesnt end like most of the movies about women in danger and big strong police the people in this movie are so good theres a temptation to put down the thriller material but even here apted has some surprises his cinematographer dante spinotti  and his visual effects supervisor art durinski cook up some visuals to let us understand what the woman can see  and what she cant see and these have the effect of making us identify with her making us strain along with her to decide what she can trust about what she sees

there is a speech in this movie about baseball that is so simple and true that it is heartbreaking and the whole attitude toward the players reflects that attitude why do they come back from the great beyond and play in this cornfield not to make any kind of vast earthshattering statement but simply to hit a few and field a few and remind us of a good and innocent time it is very tricky to act in a movie like this there is always the danger of seeming ridiculous costner and madigan create such a grounded believable married couple that one of the themes of the movie is the way love means sharing your loved ones dreams jones and lancaster create small sharp character portraits  two older men who have taken the paths life offered them but never forgotten what baseball represented to them in their youth field of dreams will not appeal to grinches and grouches and realists it is a delicate movie a fragile construction of one goofy fantasy after another but it has the courage to be about exactly what it promises if you build it he will come and he does in a baseball movie named  the natural  the hero seemed almost messianic

 sees her at the drivein he says his name is arnold friend and that he wants to be her friend everything about this guy is all wrong he is nowhere near as young as he says there is a bad look in his eye he pals around with another guy who doesnt say anything and doesnt need to because one look at him and you realize he is missing very important parts connie walks around in her shorts and halter top and arnold watches her he makes a pass at her and she puts him off with the kind of cute flirtation that would work with another kid but arnold just looks at her  looks through her  and a chill wind seems to blow one sunday when connie is left at home alone and the family is all hours away arnold comes to visit he does not physically rape her what he does is much worse than that he talks to her in a way that forever brings an end to her innocence smooth talk is not a teenage movie it is not despite its plot a horror film it is a study in deviant psychology and in the power that one person can have over another especially if one pushes in the direction where the other person is already headed the movie is almost uncanny in its selfassurance in the way it knows that the first hour where nothing happens is necessary if the payoff is to be tragic instead of merely sensational the movie is also uncanny in what it does with its last three shots i watched them and could not believe so much could be implied so simply leave the movie before it\s over and you miss almost everything because what connie does at the very end of the film is necessary it makes smooth talk the story of the process of life instead of just a sad episode

at first i thought the character of matt was unnecessary why not simply dramatize the world of firms do we need a hollywood star as an entry point for nonbritish audiences if you must have one elijah wood seems so very unlikely as a street fighter that i began a list of more plausible actors for the role then i realized the movies point is that someone like this nerdy harvard boy might be transformed in a fairly short time into a bloodthirsty gang fighter the message is that violence is hardwired into men if only the connection is made as someone who has never thrown a punch in my life i find that alien to my own feelings but i remember years ago late on nights of drinking when anger would come from somewhere and fill me certainly alcoholism is essential for firm membership it is inconceivable that anyone would go into action sober the movie was directed by lexi alexander

what we have here is the setup for a wonderful movie what we get is a very confused story photographed in such murky gloom that sometimes it is hard to be sure exactly what is happening william of baskerville listens closely and nods wisely and pokes into outoftheway corners and makes solemn pronouncements to his young novice clearly he is onto something but the screenplay is so loosely constructed that few connections are made between his conclusions and what happens next during the central sections of the film the atmosphere threatens to overwhelm the action the name of the rose was shot in a real monastery and on sets that look completely convincing but unfortunately the film takes the dark ages literally and sets its events in such inpenetrable gloom that sometimes it is almost impossible to see what is happening the large cast of characters swims in and out of view while horrible events take place a monk is found dead at the base of the tower and another is drowned in a wine vat william of baskerville moves solemnly from one event to another deliberately wisely but then the plot takes on a crazy rhythm of its own as the grand inquisitor arrives to hold a trial and ancient secrets are discovered inside the labyrinth of the tower

rated nr is more successful at visual composition than narrative momentum wouldbe sequences of black comedy are too stretched out to benefit from timing still in its cold and remote way snowman\s land maintained a certain interest for me the performances are ingratiating in their stupidity and the plot involves a nice confusion of missing bodies and mistaken motivations especially after berger turns up with his ruthless russian bodyguard and it appears sybille has gone missing at first berger assumes the slut has gone to another orgy with her arty friends and he warns his employees to double their vigilance against the inbred degenerate locals he imagines skulk through the forest plotting butchery and thievery against him where these locals live and even whether they exist is a good question although we may have glimpsed one slipping between the trees the film then subjects us to varieties of torture and doublecrosses and both walter and mickey wish they had never come anywhere near this godforsaken empty building and its sadistic landlord i can see what thomson is getting at and even sort of appreciate it at times the movie isnt boring but it meanders and loses track of plot threads any feelings we have for the characters is muted because they all richly deserve to die at one anothers hands

of course his nearmiss must be confessed immediately to beth but in terms so abstract and analytical that he seems to be diagnosing not castigating himself and in the treatment of that scene i finally began to discover that i had been through enough therapy if a movie is going to alternate between simple human spontaneity and tortured selfanalysis then it had better have a point of view toward one or the other to use them as a sort of sweetandsour of the soul is unbearably frustrating what almost redeems see you in the morning are the performances bridges is completely at home in the central role seeming relaxed around the children and convincingly decent in his relationships with the women krige is a good choice for his second wife she has a way of conveying absolute good faith and so it is painful to see her confronted with the dialogue in the big confession scene where at a crucial turning point everything she is given to say sounds false the movie was written and directed by alan j pakula

the black hole 1979 family science fiction
rated pg 98 minutes
why all the extra empty interior space perhaps to give the special effects artists their opportunity to go berserk on the visuals the black hole was designed by the veteran effects artist peter ellenshaw who avoids the look of most earlier movie spaceships walltowall computer display screens re laying meaningless information to nonexistent monitors instead his interiors consist of orderly patterns of basic colors arrayed on control panels and then there is a vast porthole looking out into space much as capt nemo\s giant porthole surveyed the ocean in ellenshaw\s designs for 20000 leagues under the sea the cygnus indeed looks more like a fanciful space vehicle for a nemo than like the fashionable high tech so beloved in most movie spaceships it\s inhabited by a crew that\s borrowed from gothic thrillers and star wars there are strange hooded zombielike figures that mope about all over the place and then there are robots the friendly robot looks like c3po from star wars and chirps out plucky little sayings while revolving its beady little eyes the taller robots are ripped off from darth vader and when everybody gets in a shootout we\re left for the umpteenth time with the reflection that gunfights would surely be obsolete in outer space can you imagine a technology that could venture to the edge of a black hole and yet equip its voyagers with sidearms that inflict only flesh wounds

there are moments of wit as when the eccentric grandmother recoils from the american teenager no hugs dear i\m british we only show affection to dogs and horses and an odd scene where daphne is locked in a bedroom released just as queen elizabeth ii is arriving at a party and flees in tearscausing her father to choose between chasing her and greeting the queen my analysis of this scene 1 he should choose to greet the queen or 19 generations of breeding have been for nothing and 2 daphne won\t get far before being returned dead or alive by the scotland yard security detail that accompanies the queen when she visits private homes i found it a little unlikely by the way that the guests at the party were all looking at daphne and not the queen paul theroux wrote of being at a dinner party for the queen and agonizing over what he should say when she entered the room suddenly seeing her famous profile all he could think of was that reminds me i need to buy postage stamps so is this movie worth seeing well everybody in it is either sweet and cute or eccentric and hateful and the movie asks the timeless question can a little girl from america find love and happiness as the daughter of a wealthy and titled english lord if you are a fan of bynes you will probably enjoy finding out the answer for yourself if not not

this failure to come to grips with the personal meaning of suicide is the fundamental reason harry kellerman doesn\t entirely succeed there\s a certain flabbiness in its philosophy and yet having gotten the thoughts about suicide off my chest i reacted very favorably to some scenes in the film and i think hoffman\s two long scenes with barbara harris are among the best cinema ive seen in some time miss harris has earned an academy award nomination hands down

this sequence is the strangest in the film the words are there but the heart is lacking murray stands center stage and rants and raves about the spirit of christmas but its not an inspiring speech and certainly not a funny one it sounds more desperate than anything else and it continues at embarrassing length it looks like an onscreen breakdown finally he demands a miracle and his secretarys little tyke is dragged forward to demonstrate that he can actually speak at last then the entire cast and crew line up behind murray to sing of christmas cheer and i cant remember when ive seen anything along these lines that was more forced and depressing what went wrong here i have no idea the chemistry must have been bad from the start or perhaps the material was simply intractable one problem is that murray frequently interjects oneliners that are at rightangles to the material blocking the flow of the story he gives the impression at those moments that he is seeking to distance himself from the film but a story like this works only if it seems to believe in itself

 who i think is the girlfriend of george  petchthai wongkamlao  a friend of tings from the village who has become corrupted by bangkok and betrays him i was paying pretty close attention i think but i cant remember for sure if ting and the girl ever get anything going maybe because any romance at all would drag the action to a halt for gooey dialogue i think they look at each other like theyll get together after the movie did i enjoy ongbak as brainless but skillful action choreography yes and i would have enjoyed it even more if i\d known going in that the stunts were being performed in the oldfashioned precomputer way ongbak even uses that old bruce lee strategy of repeating shots of each stunt from two or three angles which wreaks havoc with the theory that time flows ceaselessly from the past into the future but sure goes give us a good look when he clears the barbed wire

but the film itself at 84 minutes is overlong a minor chapter in an early career it has been carefully restored for this theatrical rerelease and the print showcases the widescreen cinematography of raoul coutard  and we can see here stylistic choices that would become omnipresent in the films to come the use of big printed words on the screen the use of bold basic colors and the use of books as objects which embody their titles in one cute moment angela and emile arent speaking and hold up books with titles that indicate what they want to say the movie is bright and lively but too precious and godard would soon make much better ones ebert writes about breathless and my life to live online in the great movies series at wwwsuntimescomebert

i will not be giving away plot secrets if i describe at this point the albino alligator connection according to an anecdote told in the movie alligators force an albino to go out first in order to flush out the opposition after which they pounce from ambush its ingenious the way fortes screenplay employs this principle and interesting the way he develops the characters walsh and dunaway try to reason with the desperados and the customers who are not all exactly who they seem have a turn theres a dynamic within the gang involving sinise who begins to think of his catholic upbringing fichtner who wants to blast everyone away and dillon who tries to keep a level head it is all done about as well as it can be done i suppose hostage movies follow such ancient patterns that its rare to be surprised by one and this one does have some surprises not very rewarding occasionally the genre will be transformed by brilliant filmmaking as it was in  dog day afternoon  not this time

based on the novel to an early grave by wallace markfield
94 minutes this is lumet\s first comedy he usually makes social dramas long day\s journey into night the pawnbroker a view from the bridge and the timing of bye bye braverman seems more suited to a serious mood than to humor there is also a tendency to slip into exaggerated jewish stereotypes alan king\s rabbi is particularly offensive and other characters speak a dialog that rings as false as stage or music hall german segal himself played a much more subtly delineated jewish character in no way to treat a lady the movie has its moments there is a scene where segal wanders through one of those endless new york cemeteries it is shot with a telephoto lens and begins with segal as a speck among a universe of gravestones segal crisscrosses his way closer to the camera which moves in on him very slowly during a long speech he tells the dead what has happened in the meantime the shot ends in closeup good things like this do not redeem bye bye braverman\s slow pace however and this must be reckoned a movie for buffs who want to observe lumet\s studied rich style a general audience would probably find it dull and would probably be right 
the frisco kid 1979 action comedy
114 minutes the longest yard  1974 as well as the unsuccessful the choirboys but aldrich\s best movies have had a certain ironic satirical tone to them the dirty dozen was a study in cynicism the frisco kid on the other hand has a certain softness at its center the wilder character has a sweetness a niceness that\s interesting for the character but doesn\t seem to work with this material its really nobodys movie the screenplay has been around hollywood for several years and aldrich seems to have taken it on as a routine assignment whats poignant about the film is that wilders performance is such a nice one hes likable plucky versatile he is in fact as good an actor here as hes ever been before and at his own brand of complex vulnerability gene wilder has never been surpassed the challenge is to find the right vehicle to find a character like sherlock holmes smarter brother wilder needs that certain cynical edge to play against in a character of mostly pleasant dimensions he gets lost

lavventura  a character disappears on an island and never appears again her friends search for her and then abandon the search which for a time gave them purpose in blow up a photographer shoots an event in a park and in studying his photographs thinks he may have photographed a murder but there is no body and the photographs yield less the more he studies them in the passenger one man becomes another and then both evaporate the girl is left in the empty piazza i did not admire the film in 1975 in a negative review i observed that antonioni had changed its title from the reporter professione reporter to the passenger apparently deciding it was about the girl not locke maybe it is simply about passengers who travels in someone else\s life locke in robertson\s the girl in locke\s i admire the movie more 30 years later i am more in sympathy with it when a film so resolutely refuses to deliver on the level of plot what we are left with is tone the passenger is about that being in a place where nobody knows you or wants to know you and you are struck by your insignificance there was a world where it was important that robertson was robertson and locke was locke in the desert among strangers it is not even important that robertson be robertson and locke be locke the little white car that crisscrosses the square in the final shot belongs to a driving school to its driver it is important to pass the course and get a driver\s license robertson and locke disappear and this is first gear this is second here is the clutch here is the brake a new print of the movie is in theaters prior to a dvd

 cuts between these characters so smoothly that even a fairly complex scenario remains clear and charged with tension like martin scorsese\s  goodfellas  traffic is fascinating at one level simply because it shows how things workhow the drugs are marketed how the laws are sidestepped the problem is like a punching bag you can hammer it all day and still it hangs there impassive unchanged the movie is powerful precisely because it doesnt preach it is so restrained that at one momentthe judges final speechi wanted one more sentence making a point but the movie lets us supply that thought for ourselves and the facts make their own argument this war is not winnable on the present terms and takes a greater toll in human lives than the drugs themselves the drug war costs 19 billion a year but scenes near the end of the film suggest that more addicts are helped by two free programs alcoholics anonymous and narcotics anonymous than by all the drug troops put together

the sequels need not fret overmuch about plot these films are really about personality dialogue and the possibility that the state has placed itself outside the law that leads to an oppressive doomladen atmosphere that the characters move through with apprehension we understand the basics of the section conspiracy we recognize most of the faces but few of us could pass a test on exactly who is who no problem neither could lisbeth or mikael the tension  and there is a lot of it  grows from the danger that lisbeth brings upon herself by refusing to act sensibly for her own welfare she has such a burnedin distrust of authority that even a friend like mikael gets closed out rapace takes a simple friendly see you and invests it with the effort it costs lisbeth to utter her battle with herself is more suspenseful than her battle against her enemies because enemies can be fought with and that provides release but we spend much of the girl who kicked the hornet\s nest straining against lisbeth\s fear and sending her urgent telepathic messages about what she should do these are all very wellmade films like most european films they have adults who are grownups not arrested adolescents mikael and erika his boss and lover have earned the lines in their faces and dont act like reckless action heroes they make their danger feel so real to us that we realize the heroes of many action movies dont really believe theyre in any danger at all lisbeth is in grave danger but in great part because of her damaged obstinacy and that scares us more than any number of 6foot4 nordic blond homicidal halfbrothers

eastwood\s film is firm in its refusal to cheapen and tarnish by inventing salacious scenes i don\t get the impression from j edgar that eastwood particularly respected hoover but i do believe he respected his unyielding public facade it is possibly hoover\s lifelong performance that fascinated him there\s a theme running through most of his films since  bird  1988 the man unshakably committed to his own idea of himself as a period biopic j edgar is masterful few films span seven decades this comfortably the sets the props the clothes and details look effortlessly right and note how eastwood handles the many supporting roles some of them depicting famous people these minor characters are all to some degree relating to hoover\s formidable public image as a person or as a character he was a star of stage screen radio and print he was said to have the goods on everyone people tiptoed around him as they might have with stalin it\s a nice touch the way eastwood and dicaprio create a character who seems to be a dead zone and make him electrifying in other actors\ reaction shots

134 minutes  and the other new entries in the ultraviolent unapologetically realistic battle film sweepstakes alas the battles in windtalkers play more like a video game although woo is asian he treats the enemy japanese troops as popup targets a faceless horde of screaming maniacs who run headlong into withering fire although americans take heavy casualties there is a point at which we assume everyone in the movie will be killed the death ratio is about 30 to 1 against the japanese since they are defending dugin positions and the americans are often exposed this seems unlikely the point of the movie is that the navajos are able to use their code in order to radio information call in strikes and allow secret communication in the real war i imagine this skill was most useful in longrange strategic radio communication windtalkers devotes minimal time to the code talkers however and when they do talk it\s to phone in coordinates for an air strike against big japanese guns since these guns cannot be moved before airplanes arrive a call in english would have had about the same effect that woo shows the windtalkers in the heat of battle is explained i think because he wants to show everything in the heat of battle the wisdom of assigning two precious code talkers to a small group of frontline soldiers in a deadly handtohand fight situation seems questionable considering there are only 400 navajos in the pacific theater the indians are seen onedimensionally as really nice guys the only character of any depth is cages sgt enders who seems to hover between shellshock and hallucinatory flashbacks there is a final scene between enders and yahzee the navajo that reminded me of the male bonding in other woo movies in which you may have to shoot the other guy to prove how much you love him but since the movie has labored to kill off all the supporting characters and spare only the stars we are in the wrong kind of suspense instead of wondering which of these people will survive we wonder which way the picture will jump in retailing warmovie formulas

the premise la femme nikita was that its heroine began as a thoroughly uncivilized character without a decent bone in her body and then after society exploited her savagery she was slowly civilized through the love of a good simple man the professional uses similar elements rearranged it is a welldirected film because besson has a natural gift for plunging into drama with a chargedup visual style and it is well acted but always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12yearold character in the middle of this action in a more serious movie or even in a human comedy like cassavetes\  gloria

 this marique shes a piece of work she has white pancake makeup blood red lips cute little facial tattoos and wickedly sharp metal talons on her fingers at one point she blows some magic dust at conan and the dust turns into a team of warriors made of sand this is a neat special effect although it raises the question if you turn back to sand when conan slices you what kind of a life is that the film ends with a very long battle involving conan khalar zym tamara and marique a sentence i never thought id write it takes place largely with tamara strapped to a revolving wheel above a vertiginous drop to flames far below mention is made of a volcano but never further explained the entire cavern crumbles around them big chunks of rock falling everywhere except luckily upon them conan the barbarian is a brutal crude witless hightech cgi contrivance in which no artificial technique has been overlooked including 3d the third dimension once again illustrates the principle that when a movie largely takes place indoors in dimly lit spaces the last thing you need is a pair of dark glasses

120 minutes  is a strange case an engaging intelligent hardworking woman who somehow fails to notice that she is married to a monster she also misses the welts on bobbys back and of course her kids feeling untrusted and abandoned do not tell her about the beatings instead they begin to plan an escape for little bobby by outfitting his radio flyer wagon with wings and an engine so it will fly and he can leave town and never come back they have some reason to think this plan will work a kid named fisher once coasted his wagon down a hill and up the slope of a barn and he flew through the sky so high he was almost able to hitch a ride on the tail of a plane that was taking off from the valley of course fisher also suffered a terrible fall and when we finally meet him late in the picture he is crippled but there you have it heroes have to take chances i will not regale you with the details by which bobbys maiden flight takes place i was so appalled watching this kid hurtling down the hill in his pathetic contraption that i didnt know which ending would be worse if he fell to his death that would be unthinkable but if he soared up to the moon it would be unforgiveable  because you cant escape from child abuse in little red wagons and even the people who made this picture should have been ashamed to suggest otherwise who was this movie made for kids adults what kid needs a movie about a frightened little boy who is at the mercy of drunken beatings what adult can suspend so much disbelief that the movie\s ending a visual ripoff from et inspires anything other than incredulity what hypothetical viewer could they possibly have had in mind radio flyer was a famous screenplay by david mickey evans

thief 1981 action crime drama thriller
rated r 122 minutes
this\r\nmovie works so well for several reasons one is that thief is able\r\nto convince us that it knows its subject knows about the methods and criminal\r\npersonalities of its characters another is that it\s well cast every\r\nimportant performance in this movie successfully creates a plausible person\r\ninstead of the stockcompany supporting characters we might have expected and\r\nthe film moves at a taut pace creating tension and anxiety through very\r\neffective photography and a woundup pulsing score by tangerine dream  if\r\nthief has a weak point it is probably in the handling of the\r\nwillie nelson character nelson is set up well he became caan\s fatherfigure\r\nin prison caan loves him more than anybody and when he goes to visit him in\r\nprison they have a conversation that is subtly written to lead by an indirect\r\nroute to nelson\s understated revelation that he is dying and does not want to\r\ndie behind bars this scene is so strong that it sets us up for big things we\r\nexpect willie to get out get involved in the plot and be instrumental in the\r\nclimax that doesn\t happen there is a very nice courtroom scene during which\r\nyou\ll have to pay close attention to catch on to the subverbal and illegal\r\nconversation conducted between the judge and the lawyer but then the nelson\r\ncharacter quickly disappears from the movie and we\re surprised and a little\r\ndisappointed willie has played the character so well that we wanted more but\r\nthen i suppose it is a good thing when a movie creates characters we feel that\r\nstrongly about and thief is populated with them it\s a thriller\r\nwith plausible people in it how rare

90 minutes  and a particularly bad evening of saturday night live but martin short is clearly not a little boy he is a curious adult pretending to be a little boy with odd verbal mannerisms like always addressing his uncle with lines like oh yes my uncle and fawning up to strangers like a horny spaniel if clifford is not a real little boy then what is he the movie doesn\t know and neither does the audience and for much of the running time we sit there staring stupefied at the screen trying to figure out what the hell we\re supposed to be thinking grodin emerges relatively unscathed because as a smooth underactor he is able to distance himself from the melee steenburgen is given a scene where coleman assaults her in the back of a limousine for no reason that the movie really explains short has a couple of dance routines that have more to do with his snl history than with this movie and then there is the climax in which uncle martin finally does take little clifford to the dinosaur park the movie treats the sequence as a bravura set piece but actually it\s an embarrassing assembly of shabby special effects resulting in absolutely no comic output at one point the movie sets up an outofcontrol thrill ride and we in the audience think we know how the laughs will build but we\re wrong they don\t to return to the underlying causes for the movies failure what we have here is a suitable case for deep cinematic analysis id love to hear a symposium of veteran producers marketing guys and exhibitors discuss this film its not bad in any usual way its bad in a new way all its own there is something extraterrestrial about it as if its based on the sense of humor of an alien race with a completely different relationship to the physical universe the movie is so odd its almost worth seeing just because well never see anything like it again i hope

for some language and innuendo the movie is not perfect it has been shot on a budget close to the minimum wage and has the usual problem of crowd scenes without a large enough crowd but it takes joy in its work and that makes up for a lot eartha kitt has a small but very functional role singing a song wonderfully and offering the kind of advice that absolutely must be supplied in a plot of this kind was it kitts idea or the filmmakers that after offering that advice she doesnt get all sentimental but stays tartly in character reminding billie that she is the star and billie is the waitress i liked that moment one obvious flaw there is a wedding scene i will not say who with or even whether it is real or not  and no dont think thats a hint the scene bursts into fantasy and imaginings at precisely that moment when it should be played straight in order to exploit the emotions the movie has been building toward but in general the movie works just as it wants to and you will either enjoy it for that or you will be the kind of person for whom the names kathryn grayson doris day  howard keel

 shes a lawyer a widow with a daughter and we sense immediately that theres unfinished passion between them perhaps people suspected that and tied it to the dead panthers betrayal this is not an action film it is a movie about loss sadness and regret and the feeling that history has moved on bostic symbolizes that by having joined the black mus\xadlims a group which by then represented a similar rejection of white society and even a some what similar iconography bostic is finished with the past he cant wait to sell the family house night catches us wisely avoids many of the situations this setup might suggest  situations that have been played out in countless other films it doesn\t turn into a street war or a whodunit its emotional center is the understanding that grows between marcus and patricia they\re good people capable of useful lives trying to free themselves from the chains of the past she never believed he was a snitch perhaps they can find reconciliation and acceptance the film leads to no showy conclusion no spectacular climax it is about movement possible within the soul even in difficult times the writerdirector tanya hamilton

137 minutes early in the film theres a scene where a feckless middleaged man named shimon haretz  allan corduner  hopes to join the group and is asked what he does he thinks maybe hes  an intellectual this is no use to the partisans although he is allowed to stay at the time of the story the region was largely agrarian and peasant and many were skilled craftsmen artisans and laborers i thought im also an  intellectual of what use would i be in the forest the film works in a way as a cautionary tale most of us live in a precarious balance above the bedrock of physical labor someday we may all be shimon haretz the best performance because its more nuanced is by liev schreiber his zus bielski is more concerned with the big picture more ideological more driven by tactics daniel craig is very effective as tuvia the group leader but his character perhaps of necessity is concerned primarily with the organization discipline and planning of the group a farmer he becomes an administrator chief authority and court of last resort

73 minutes all is well until stirrings of discontent are heard even in the most hospitable of communities there are always malcontents who dont want a camel hanging around the camel smells and is unlovely and it relieves itself in the street and the sawickis begin to stand out from the crowd they are the people who have the camel in 1973 when kieslowski wrote his screenplay perhaps he saw it as a parable about life under the sameness and regimentation of communism but even in a democracy human nature is intolerant of those who are different and to own a camel is to be different in a capitalist society this film might not be made because the story is not commercial in 1973 there were state sources in poland for production funds but i have no idea if the big animal was turned down by the authorities it is the kind of story that could be seen as a satirical attack on the government or on the other hand it might simply be the tale of a camel you never know it is whimsical bittersweet wise in a minor key i am reminded of a story that the directorwriter dusan makevejev once told me when there was a yugoslavia it had a censor whose job was to approve film scripts the censor was a friend of makavejevs they had gone to school together makevejev submitted a script and the censor called him into his office dusan dusan dusan he said sorrowfully you know what this story is about and i know what this story is about now go home and rewrite it so only the audience knows what it is about

88 minutes  and santos  alex dimitriades  under the timehonored code of horror movies they will disappear in horrible ways in inverse proportion to their billingalthough of course theres also the possibility theyll turn up again the most absorbing passages in the film involve their exploration of the deserted liner the quality of the art direction and photography actually evoke some of the same creepy haunting majesty of those documentaries about descents to the grave of the titanic theres more scariness because we know how the original passengers and crew members died that opening scene has a grisly humor and because the ship still seems hauntednot only by that sadeyed little girl but perhaps by others the mystery eventually yields an explanation if not a solution and there is the obligatory twist in the last shot which encourages us to reinterpret everything in diabolical terms and to think hard about the meanings of certain names but the appeal of ghost ship is all in the process not in the climax i liked the vast old empty ballroom the deserted corridors and the sense of a party that ended long ago the effect is of a nautical version of miss havisham\s sealed room i knew that there would be unexpected shocks sudden noises and cadaverous materializations but i have long grown immune to such mechanical thrills unless they are done well of course i just dug the atmosphere

the movie has slick production values and a few clever lines and is an invaluable illustration of the principle of evil marksmanship this principle you will recall from my glossary of movie terms teaches us that in the movies the bad guys can never hit anything with a gun and the good guys can hardly miss the villains typically fire thousands of rounds from machine guns after which the heroes roll out of the line of fire and squeeze off a few welldirected rounds from their handguns killing an enemy with every shot the relevant scene in double impact has to be seen to be believed as countless rounds are poured into a car from numerous hidden assassins all of whom somehow fail to hit anyone who is going to be needed later in the movie movies like this always seem to draw enthusiastic audiences largely consisting of intenselooking adolescent males who study the martial arts moves carefully and dissolutelooking older males who hoot and cheer as if each death is the visual equivalent of a punch line whether they prefer one martial arts hero to another i cannot say my own favorite is steven seagal because he seems more introspective and thoughtful a philosopher who has been forced into violence by the nature of our unkind universe van damme who is belgian and unlike many of his countrymen can speak english virtually without an accent has more conventional good looks than most of his competitors projects less inner complexity and seems thoroughly comfortable with his feet above his head a position many martial arts experts often find themselves in

97 minutes consider for example the scene where zack seeks laney in the fastfood joint where she works mcdonald\s would be too much of a cliche this is a middle eastern franchise would you like to supersize those falafel balls consider a scene that plays in the foreground while laney\s dad is watching jeopardy in the background and shouting out the answers to a question about the printer of the most famous bible in history he shouts out hewlettpackard i couldn\t quite catch the question for which his answer is lou rawls and the correct answer is the pope moments like that are almost better than the movie deserves so is the way the movie treats taylor the villainess who tries to seduce the vain brock while he\s watching himself on tv and is told to stop getting spit on his chest and although it\s obligatory to have a party scene at which the bad girl humiliates the good girl by pouring something down her dress i liked the way taylor told laney she was a waste of perfectly good yearbook space high school movies never seem that convincing to me maybe because all the students seem to be in their 20s and don\t have zits freddie prinze jr i learn is 23 and rachael leigh cook is 20 still they have a charm in their roles muted somewhat in cook\s case because the plot requires her to be sullen much of the time she lurks in the basement painting large dark canvases and at first zack doesn\t realize he\s really falling in love with her but of course he is and although she resists his advances what is this some kind of a dork outreach program nothing can stand in the way of the happy ending watching the movie i was grateful to the director robert iscove  and the writer r lee fleming jr for taking this weary material and doing what they could with it there\s so little wit in the movies today too many characters speak in big clunky declarative sentences that serve only to push the plot ahead of them like people trying to shove their cars out of the snow she\s all that is not a great movie but it has its moments

99 minutes  on the screen we see landscapes such as van gogh might have seen and we visit some of the places where he painted but there are fictionalized created sequences as well scenes of farmers in their fields or peasants walking down country lanes or shadows sweeping across fields of sunflowers and there is a magical sequence in which the people in a room go about their daily business until they arrange themselves seemingly by accident into a reproduction of a painting sometimes cox makes no effort to photograph specific things that van gogh might have seen or been influenced by instead his camera visits woods and fields and watches birds and flowers and meanders down alleyways populated with people who seem to harbor some of the weariness and fear of so many of van goghs models the words continue over these images as well creating the illusion that the painter is narrating the film himself the best parts of the film are the most specific cox uses closeups to show the smallest details of some of the paintings while the narration describes the painters technical discoveries and experiments there are times when we almost seem to be looking at the very brushstroke that van gogh is describing in a letter these moments create a sense of the specific we arent looking at stars in the sky or fields of flowers or a portrait of the artist were looking at frozen moments in time when van goghs brush moved just such a way in response to his feeling and his craft the strokes seem enormous on the big movie screen and they call our attention to the detail to the way that van goghs paintings were not about their subjects but about the way he saw his subjects so much of the popular image of van gogh is crude and inaccurate fed by the notion that he was mad fueled by the fact that he cut off his ear there is an entirely different vincent here a poetic thoughtful man who confides everything to his brother who is not mad so much as completely open to the full range of his experience including those parts that most of us prudently suppress vincent is the most romantic and yet the most sensible documentary about a painter i have ever seen

 but the energy level in the impostors is too laidback for screwball the movie is gentle and whimsical not manic and there are times when tucci seems to be chewing more than he has bit off i liked the way the two lead characters maurice and arthur share a deep friendship and finish each others sentences i liked the way lily the social director feels an instant sympathy for them but the mad bomber plot and the other intrigues require characters at a boil and everyone in this movie just sort of simmers sweetly there are laughs but they are quiet chuckles i found myself smiling a lot i felt fond of the characters there is the same warmth that permeated big night but there is also the same impulse to bring people on board who don\t seem to have a reason for being in the plot rossellini\s sad queen for example signifies a great deal but reveals little her character feels more like tucci said he\d write a role for her than like the character needed to exist and she was the perfect person to play it there are movies that work and then movies like the impostors that don\t really work but are pleasant all the same there was nothing i actively disliked about the film but my affection was more polite than impassioned if this had been a first draft i would have advised throwing some characters overboard and turning up the heat under the others

105 minutes listen also to the dialogue by robert munic and montiel which is far above formula boilerplate and creates the illusion that the characters might actually be saying it in the moment an extended flirtation between zulay and shawn isnt hurried through for a bedroom payoff but grows sweeter and more tender as it continues this scene illustrates my theory that it is more exciting to wonder if you are about to be kissed than it is to be kissed fighting is not a cinematic breakthrough but it is much more involving than i thought it would be the ads foreground the action no doubt because that\s what sells the film transcends the worldview that produced the ad campaign and gives audiences a wellcrafted touching experience sometimes you can feel it when an audience is a little surprised by how deeply they\ve become involved

all of these serious questions linger just under the surface of mississippi masala which is despite its subject surprisingly funny and cheerful at times and generates a fullblown romanticism denzel washington is an actor of immense and natural charm and he makes a good match with sarita choudhury a newcomer who seems a little awkward in some of her scenes but uses that feeling as part of her performance if i have a complaint about nairs work its that she tries to cover too much ground she knows a lot about her subject but should have decided what was important and left out the rest the scenes in uganda for example are not necessary for narrative purposes and her closing scenes as the father returns to the home of 20 years earlier upstages the conclusion of the love story she also has a lot of material about the daily lives of indians in mississippi and while i find some of it amusing and all of it interesting it also serves to keep the young lovers out of the foreground for extended periods of screen time there are really three movies here the exile from uganda the love story the lives of indians in the deep south and really only screen time enough for one of them

 a few days before i saw no mercy and so at first i was crossreferencing his standard mannerisms such as that way he struts across the screen then he sold me on the character and i stopped thinking about gere and started caring about what was going to happen next with basinger that process was even easier although she fits all of the usual requirements for a movie sexpot there is within her the genuine soul of an artist and she throws herself into this role so convincingly that there is real pathos in her history there is enough conviction in their relationship that it carries over even into the obligatory bloodbath that ends the film and i found myself caring about them even while on another level i was running an inventory of the special effects the movies climax a shootout in a flophouse across the river from new orleans is an anthology of action cliches and a few fresher touches such as the villains ability to ram through walls its always a shame when a movie bothers to create interesting characters and then discards them in a hightech climax but up until then no mercy is an aboveaverage film noir and its creepy feeling for the back streets of new orleans and the sultry evil of its redlight suburbs got under my skin

102 minutes the movie is thrown out of proportion unfortunately by its need to seem to star coburn steve ihnat  an excellent actor directing for the first time fills in the gaps by giving us long takes of coburn walking while songs are sung and he throws in a hatstealing scene that is plain ridiculous there also are a couple of interludes with a rich local indian girl who wants coburn but he doesn\t much want her her character is completely unbelievable do even moviestyle wicked women still say i always get what i want anymore a sexist parody of the hot little rich girl all of these things go wrong and yet there\s that relationship at the heart of the film between slim pickens and lois nettleton and that goes right

ted griffin  provides nice small moments of color for the characters i liked the way jeffrey jones\ co seemed reasonable in the most appalling ways and short spare lines of dialogue that do their work he was licking me\\ i also liked the way characters unexpectedly reappeared and how the movie savors boyd\s inability to get anyone to believe him and i admired the visceral music by michael nyman and damon albarn which calls attention to itself common but deserves to rare ravenous\\ is clever in the way it avoids most of the cliches of the vampire movie by using cannibalism and most of the cliches of the cannibal movie by using vampirism it serves both dishes with new sauces

 who seems obsessed with sara evers flashbacks explain why in antebellum new orleans gracey was in love with a young woman who looked exactly like sara and when they could not marry they both killed themselves which means gracey is a ghost of course but leaves unanswered the question of why he could not marry the ghost of his original lover and stop haunting respectable married realtorstm the movies most intriguing element is the way it does and doesnt deal with the buried racial theme we learn that the sinister ramsley sabotaged his masters romance because if he married the family would be destroyed presumably that would be because an interracial romance was dangerous in old new orleans but the movie never says so and indeed never refers to the races of any of its characters that is either a refreshing and admirable or b puzzling since the whole plot is motivated by race the story in any event gives the characters a lot to deal with which means we are not relegated to a movie full of banging doors swinging chandeliers and other ghostly effects there are a lot of those of course especially as the kids make their own way around the gloomy pile but there is a certain poignancy about the central dilemma and the gracey character reflects it well eventually answering one of the questions posed above although i will not say which one

124 minutes quaid and gyllenhaal and the small band of new york survivors do what can be done with impossible dialogue in an unlikely situation and dr lucy hall  sela ward  jacks wife and sams mother struggles nobly in her subplot which involves the little cancer patient named peter she stays by his side after the hospital is evacuated calling for an ambulance which we think is a tad optimistic since manhattan has been flooded up to about the eighth floor the water has frozen and its snowing but does the ambulance arrive heres another one for you remember those wolves that escaped from the zoo think well see them again

gordon warnecke  an actor unknown to me as a bright but passive youth who hasnt yet figured out the strategy by which he will approach the world he is a blank slate pleasant agreeable not readily showing the sorrows and angers that we figure ought to be inside there somewhere the most expansive character in the movie is nasser  saeed jaffrey  an engaging hedonist who doesnt see why everyone shouldnt enjoy live with the cynical good cheer he possesses the viewer is likely to go through a curious process while watching this film at first there is unfamiliarity who are these people and where do they come from and what sort of society do they occupy in england we get oriented fairly quickly and understand the values that are at work then we begin to wonder what the movie is about it is with some relief that we realize it isn\t about anything it\s simply some weeks spent with some characters in a way that tells us more about some aspects of modern britain than we\ve seen before

99 minutes  in that one you will remember the heroine a lawyer has to decide in a hurry whether she can trust the man she\s defending there\s a little of that in this movie too burt reynolds is given a few moments when he projects some menace and mystery just enough for us to suspect he really may have committed the crime but then the plot doesnt follow through on that and before long the story has settled into very familiar patterns the movies basic idea is rolereversal in the hepburn and tracy mold with reynolds as the untamed ruffian and russell as the nononsense lady who will love him only if he straightens out this leads almost exactly where we anticipate it will with all of the plot threads coming together into suspense danger innocence threat and of course living happily ever after the problem is that there is no chemistry at all between reynolds and russell they stand near each other and speak words of emotion but theres not much light in their eyes and they dont budge the needle on the romantic voltmeter

the actors assembled for nicholas nickleby are not only well cast but well typecast each one by physical appearance alone replaces a page or more of dickens\ descriptions allowing mcgrath to move smoothly and swiftly through the story without laborious introductions they are obviously who they are the result is a movie that feels like a complete account of dickens\ novel even though the royal shakespeare company found an additional seven hours of inspiration the physical production is convincing without being too charming or too realistic the clothes of some of the characters remind us that in those days their wardrobes would have consisted only of what they wore the countryside is picturesque but falls short of greeting cards except for the nicklebys\ cottage at the end the story takes place at about the same time as scorsese\s  gangs of new york  but london is heavier on alehouses lighter on blood in the gutters the movie makes dickens\ world look more pleasant to inhabit than it probably was but then so did his novels

the result is a considerable achievement a revisionist history linking the birth of american democracy and american crime it brings us astonishing sights as in a scene that shows us the inside of a tenement with families stacked on top of one another in rooms like shelves or in the ferocity of the draft riots which all but destroyed the city it is instructive to be reminded that modern america was forged not in quiet rooms by great men in wigs but in the streets in the clash of immigrant groups in a bloody darwinian struggle all of this is a triumph for scorsese and yet i do not think this film is in the first rank of his masterpieces it is very good but not great i wrote recently of goodfellas that the film has the headlong momentum of a storyteller who knows he has a good one to share i didn\t feel that here scorsese\s films usually leap joyfully onto the screen the work of a master in command of his craft here there seems more struggle more weight to overcome more darkness it is a story that scorsese has filmed without entirely internalizing the gangsters in his earlier films are motivated by greed ego and power they like nice cars shoes suits dinners women they murder as a cost of doing business the characters in gangs of new york kill because they like to and want to they are bloodthirsty and motivated by hate i think scorsese liked the heroes of goodfellas  casino  and  mean streets

91 minutes come to think of it the alligator does a lot of slinking in this movie  maybe because it was too difficult to show the whole alligator there are a couple of fairly phony special effects shots as when the alligator bursts up through the sidewalk but for the most part we just see parts of the alligator his mean little eyes his big tall and his teeth especially his teeth the plot is absolutely standard absolutely standard this story has been filmed dozens of times you have of course the small minded mayor who is concerned only with reelection the police chief a folksy character who fires forster for not catching the alligator but later rehires him the girl scientist who falls in love with the hero and helps hunt for the alligator the villain an outoftown big game hunter brought in to replace forster all of these people do incredibly stupid things like walking into dark alleys after the alligator or putting a dynamite charge on a timedelay fuse while theyre still trapped in a sewer with the alligator and the dynamite the alligator on the other hand is smart enough to travel all over the city without being seen in one shot hes in a suburban swimming pool and seconds later hes midtown you would not think it would be that easy for a 40foot alligator to sneak around incognito but then new yorkers are awfully blase meanwhile i suggest a plan why not try flushing this movie down the toilet to see if it also grows into something big and fearsome

firstborn 1984 103 minutes
up until about this point in the movie firstborn has been a very accurately observed family drama one that even bears comparison to  ordinary people  the performances are strong the plot moves with a compelling simplicity and the dialogue shows a good ear for the way the movie\s different kinds of characters might really speak i was experiencing that special confidence you feel when a movie is making the right choices this was going to be a good one it did not alas turn out to be so good having raised its issues having trapped the children in a cruel dilemma how can they turn in the boyfriend without implicating their mother in a drug case having created in a dramatic form the kind of problem that does confront real families firstborn throws away all its good work on a canned formula ending would you believe a chase and a fight would you believe the little brother coming to the rescue with a baseball bat would you believe a threedimensional sensitive family drama that tries to resolve itself like a tv action show the climactic scenes in firstborn are so dismally predictable that i even got a little angry the movie had been so good that somehow it didn\t have the right to evade all the issues it had raised and just turn into a suburban thriller

it is difficult to portray a writer\s life sylvia handles that by incorporating a good deal of actual poetry into the movie read by or to the characters or in voiceover it also captures the time of their lives they were young in the 1950s and that was another world england gloomed through postwar poverty there were shortages of everything red wine and candles made you a bohemian poets were still considered extremely important and freud was being ported wholesale into literature poets took their neuroses as their subjects literary criticism was taken seriously because it was written in english that could be understood and had not yet imploded into academic puzzlemaking to be good in that time was to be very good and plath and hughes both were firstrate there are two questions the movie dodges we dont know the precise nature of hughes cheating and we dont understand how plath felt about the children she was leaving behind  why she thought it was acceptable to leave them the second question has no answer the answer to the first is supplied by hughes critics who accuse him of womanizing but the film dilutes that with the suggestion that he simply could not stay in the same house any longer with sylvia imagine a hypothetical moviegoer who has not heard of plath or hughes or read any of their poetry that would include almost everyone at the multiplex is there anything in sylvia for them yes in a way a glimpse of literary lives at a time when they were more central than they are now a touching performance by paltrow and a portrait of a depressive

drama history war 101 minutes
the swiss woman takes them in and feeds them trying to shelter them from the curiosity of her neighbors at first the womans husband is opposed to giving the refugees shelter they will eat too much and cause too many problems but getting to know them he begins to care for them the people of the small village soon all know about the new arrivals and a policeman arrives to make the official investigation and it is here that the movie becomes most bitter in an extraordinary scene in which the refugees try to arrange themselves into a grouping that will satisfy the swiss legal requirements what if the soldier plays the woman\s husband or what if the soldier claims deserter status and the woman\s brother pretends to be her husband will he look too young can the kids pretend to be the children of this couple these are all after all just people mere human beings asking for a place to stay where they will not be exterminated because of their race it is tragic to see them try to fit themselves into suitable categories in the end most of them are not allowed to stay regulations you know the swiss are civilized and responsible and have policies that have all been well thoughtout and so exceptions cannot be made and these people who do not fit the categories are shipped back across the border to germany where hitler has his own categories which provide for their extermination and life goes on in neutral switzerland where the eggs are still rationed and the banks are still open the boat is full is effective as a human document but artistically it is not quite so powerful the director markus lmhoof cuts from one story element to another somewhat abruptly so that the editing forms the movie into chunks instead of letting the story flow the crucial train scene at the beginning is not convincing we do not believe that this weary and wounded ragtag band could elude the searching nazi soldiers this could have been a better movie but it could hardly have been a more heartbreaking one

127 minutes the movie is a triumph of technical credits the cinematographer is thierry arbogast  the production designer is dan weil and the special effects are by digital domain which created the futuristic mars in total recall\\ and remember that besson conceived of these sights and had the audacity to believe his strange visions could make a movie for that i am grateful i would not have missed seeing this film and i recommend it for its richness of imagery but at 127 minutes which seems a reasonable length it plays long there is way too much of the tiresome disc jockey character late in the movie when the plot should be focused on business sequences are allowed to drag on perhaps because so much work and expense went into creating them the editor sylvie landra is ultimately responsible for the pacing but no doubt besson hovered over her shoulder in love with what he had wrought a fierce trimming would preserve what makes the fifth element\\ remarkable and remove what makes it redundant there\s great stuff here and the movie should get out of its own way

98 minutes  a movie that did feel like it took place in prehistory the clan of the cave bear is about the first generation of designer cavemen the performances are doomed from the start because the actors are asked to play characters who are modern in everything but dress and language every one of these people has motives that are instantly recognizable and predictable there is no sense of the alien and the unknown no sense that these people have ideas and feelings that would be strange to us even their quasireligion is familiar they believe each person has an animal spirit which is its partner or symbol and that if a persons spirit is strong it gives them strength this is pseudoanthropology crossed with indian folklore and the boy scouts the ending of the clan of the cave bear emphasizes its bankruptcy because there isn\t really an ending just a conclusion  a romantic shot of the woman continuing on her lonely quest the great failure of the movie is a failure of imagination the filmmakers made no effort to empathize with their prehistoric characters to imagine what it might have really been like back then

michael cahill  doesnt exactly convince me that this film cried out to be his debut as he follows into the strange places charlie leads him but at least he wants to work off the map and not turn out another standard study of angst violence or terminal hipness we have not seen these characters before which is a rare gift from a movie charlie and miranda make observations along the way about how things have changed even in her young life some of them involve the family\s old neighborhood which they used to have to themselves before all the other homeowners moved in and turned it into a suburb we used to be surrounded by nothing he says her reply is that they still are but now nothing has a population i know how he feels every time i pass the yuppie restaurants on the stretch of clark street formerly dominated by the last stop before expressway liquor store there is a belief in this movie that a flywheel like charlie is actually saner than the boring people around him at least he embraces life and goes for the gold but there is a name for his condition and he quite possibly may have been discharged prematurely no matter how his quest concludes it will not be for a mentalhealth professional a happy ending but we are not professionals and we enjoy him instead of diagnosing him when you stand back a step from the movie you admire douglas and wood for starting with potentially unplayable characters and playing them so well we actually care about a quest that in a way seems more designed for abbott and costello

118 minutes the actresses playing these roles are all well known in poland where i assume they are easy to distinguish to an outsider like myself they tended to resemble each other and i was able to follow them by story and plot more easily than facially this is not really a problem because all are facets of the same experience anna remains the central figure refusing to accept that her husband is dead until she finally receives the truth from an eyewitness to his remains so did many loved ones cling to hope as the powmia relatives do in this country the dead had no peace they were dug up by the nazis to expose soviet crimes then dug up again and metaphorically dug up in revisionist history the film ends with a scene of relentless horror showing the assembly line of execution men are taken from the sealed buses one by one their names checked off a list then quickly walked to their place of death and killed with a bullet to the back of the skull their bodies fall or are heaved into mass graves in orderly progress falling side by side and buried by bulldozer now wajda has brought some small measure of rest to their names to poland and to history note katyn was one of this years oscar nominees for best foreign language film

100 minutes there aren\t many movie actors we simply like marilyn monroe was one and that quality not sex appeal is why she has remained such a durable memory on the basis of speed and while you were sleeping sandra bullock may be another she plays lucy in a low key as a shy unassertive young woman and so of course late in the film when she has to stand up for herself we\re proud of her she makes us feel protective and bill pullman has real charisma too he\s got the right chemistry for this love story in which sweetness is more important than passion as for the plot there is a point at which it seems predictable and then we get beyond that point and start enjoying its predictability because once we see where it\s headed there is pleasure in watching it delay and prolong the inevitable  toying with cliches as if they were new playthings it has a lot of fun for example with the other man in lucy\s life an unwanted downstairs neighbor who knows he isn\t loved and has lines like i seen the way you looked at him  like you just saw your first transam light romantic comedy is one of the trickiest of all movie genres usually it doesn\t work sometimes it does as in when harry met sally     sleepless in seattle

defenders of the film and there are many speak of kiarostamis willingness to accept silence passivity a slow pace deliberation inactivity viewers who have short attention spans will grow restless we learn but if we allow ourselves to accept kiarostamis time sense if we open ourselves to the existential dilemma of the main character then we will sense the films greatness but will we i have abundant patience with long slow films if they engage me i fondly recall taiga the eighthour documentary about the yurtdwelling nomads of outer mongolia i understand intellectually what kiarostami is doing i am not impatiently asking for action or incident what i do feel however is that kiarostami\s style here is an affectation the subject matter does not make it necessary and is not benefited by it if we\re to feel sympathy for badhi wouldn\t it help to know more about him to know in fact anything at all about him what purpose does it serve to suggest at first he may be a homosexual not what purpose for the audiencewhat purpose for badhi himself surely he must be aware his intentions are being misinterpreted and why must we see kiarostami\s camera crewa tiresome distancing strategy to remind us we are seeing a movie if there is one thing taste of cherry does not need it is such a reminder the film is such a lifeless drone that we experience it only as a movie

85 minutes the movie intends to show us the frightening possibilities of antiabortion legislation and its prochoice position is made clear by the photos of an aged dan quayle on the walls and the naming of a womens prison after george bushs second home walkers point given their way and following their logic the movie argues the antiabortionists will eventually pass laws punishing abortion in the same way as kidnapping and murder of course that would be perfectly logical if abortion is murder then it should be punished in the same way women who have abortions should be executed or imprisoned for life and abortionists should be tried as accomplices the failure of antiabortion groups to advocate the death penalty for abortionists and their clients shows either a lack of conviction about their central premise or a lack of the nerve to follow it to its obvious conclusion none of which has anything to do with the experience of seeing rain without thunder which takes the form of a documentary  a very bad documentary  in which an endless parade of witnesses drones morosely into the camera as an inquiring reporter tries to piece together the story some of the characters in the film are such bad actors that everything they say sounds as if it is being read or recited by rote memory others including talented actors such as jeff daniels  sound so lifeless one wonders if the director feared the energy of vernacular speech

the movie is fastpaced centered around two big chase scenes and ending in a clever doublecross that leads to a big shootout in its action and violence it shows us how the movies have changed since 1974 the conversation is a similar story that depended only on its intelligence and paranoia for appeal enemy of the state shoehorns in brief scenes between the lawyer and his wife  regina king  and former girlfriend  lisa bonet  but is in too much of a hurry to be much of a people picture and the standoff at the end edges perilously close to the ridiculous for a movie thats tried so hard to be plausible

what is interesting is the way mann tests these roles with the women the wives and girlfriends in this movie are always in a sense standing at the kitchen door calling to the boys to come in from their play pacinos wife played by venora with a smart bitterness is the most unforgiving she is married to a man who brings corpses into bed with him in his dreams her daughter rebellious and screwed up is getting no fathering from him their marriage is a joke and when he catches her with another man she accurately says he forced her to demean herself the other women played by judd and brenneman are not quite so insightful they still have some delusions although brenneman who plays a graphic artist balks as any modern woman would when this strange secretive man expects her to leave her drawing boards and her computer and follow him to uncertainty in new zealand michael manns writing and direction elevate this material

full metal jacket  brings presence to the role of a tv evangelist by playing him with a certain dignity instead of using the standard approach to such roles and playing him as a hysterical clown but other comic opportunities are blown there is for example an expensive set of a jimandtammystyle religious theme park that doesn\t generate a single laugh a mystery is concealed somewhere in the folds of the movies plot but one that will not surprise anyone who has seen half a dozen other mysteries the identity of the bad guy can be deduced by applying the law of character economy which states that the mystery villain is always the only character in the plot who seems otherwise unnecessary it admittedly takes a little more thought than usual to apply the law in this case since so many of the characters seem unnecessary

one element evoked by the movie is the symbolic role of the american flag during the perioda time that also inspired the hardhat patriotism of joe and the john prine lyric your flag decal won\t get you into heaven anymore  it\s already overcrowded from that dirty little war abbie hoffman is seen wearing an american flag shirt and getting in trouble for desecrating it the movie cuts to footage of roy rogers and dale evans yodeling while wearing their flag shirts hoffman insisted that the flag represented all americans including those opposed to the war he resisted efforts of the right to annex it as their exclusive ideological banner vincent donofrio has an interesting task playing the role since hoffman seems on autopilot much of the time he is charismatic and has an instinctive grasp of the dramatic gesture but can be infuriating on a onetoone level the women in his life sometimes wonder whether he really sees and hears them and can understand what he puts them through both garofalo and tripplehorn are valuable to the film because they supply the eyes through which we see a man who couldnt clearly see himself

110 minutes but of waiting for godot and the myth of sisyphus that luckless greek assigned by the gods to spend eternity rolling a stone uphill so that he can watch it roll back down again the director philip haas  roots his story in gritty realism theres a great deal about the mechanics of wallbuilding and the offduty hours of nashe and pozzi are used to develop their suspicions and resentments particularly when calvins daughter tiffany  samantha mathis  appears on the scene
